Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Maskot / Getty Images TheNational Institute of Mental Health(NAMH) estimates that 31% of U.S. adults may experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. If we allow our anxiety to spiral without adequately dealing with it, our symptoms can become way worse. In addition, it can impact our relationships with our partners, family, and friends and interfere with our work. To help address anxiety, try one or more of the following self-soothing techniques. “Excessive worryis a symptom of anxiety. The worry jar exercise helps to move on from worrying by acknowledging your thoughts and then giving distance to them,” explainsKatelyn Anderson, a licensed independent clinical social worker. Close your eyes and envision the following: This exercise can be guided imagery or with a pen, paper, and a recycled jar. Physically placing the closed jar of worries aside and out of the way is symbolic of controlling your response to them and letting them go. Positive affirmationsare short, powerful statements that help you to challenge your negative thoughts. Affirmations boost our self-confidence and help us to focus on the positives versus dwelling on the negatives. It takes practice, but over time you will notice a shift. Start by choosing an affirmation you’d like to focus on, such as: Repeat your affirmation slowly five to 10 times, allowing yourself to truly feel and absorb the message. Breathe deeply between each repetition to further connect to your body during the moment. “Journaling can help you process your thoughts and feelings, as well as allow you to see them from a new point of view,” explains Anderson. “Whether you're jotting down a to-do list for the next day or writing a lengthy reflection, journaling helps us slow down, calm down, and put challenges into perspective.” There are different ways to format a journal entry. Try experimenting with the following, and allow yourself to change your journaling approach as necessary to help maintain motivation. Need a breather? Take this free2-minute meditation for instant calm—or choose from ourguided meditation libraryto find another one that will help you feel your best. Thisself-soothingtechnique is especially effective in the moment when you feel your stress and anxiety rising or spiraling. Here are a few ways you canphysically ground yourself: Under anxiety, our breathing tends to become quick and shallow, depriving our body of essential oxygen. This can create a cyclical effect, where we feel anxious, take shallow breaths, get more anxious, and then breathe even more poorly. Breathing exercisesgive us control over our breath in the moment, which can help us feel better physically and mentally. Box breathing is a simple breathing exercise you can do at any time. It gets its name because it involves four equal parts: an exhale while counting to four, holding lungs empty for four counts, inhaling for four counts, holding air for four counts, then exhaling again before repeating. If you're experiencing ongoing anxiety, you're not alone. The above coping strategies can help curb excessive worry, but if you find yourself unable to manage your anxiety, then we recommend seeking help from a therapist. Together, you'll be able to identify some of your common anxiety triggers, come up with a treatment plan, and develop healthy pathways to handle ongoing anxiety.

https://www.verywellmind.com/generalized-anxiety-disorder-4166193,dynamic,Mental Health,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a specific type of anxiety disorder. Most people worry at times about their health, job, money, or family, but people with GAD experience anxiety about these things and more, in a way that is persistent, excessive, and intrusive.1 Often, people with GAD struggle to relax and have trouble concentrating on tasks. They may experience physical symptoms including restlessness, sweating, difficulty swallowing, and using the restroom a lot. While symptoms of anxiety can be debilitating, with proper treatment—including medication and psychotherapy—people can learn to manage their symptoms and live a more productive life. The 3-3-3 rule is a grounding strategy that people can use when they feel overwhelmed by feelings of anxiety. To do this technique, you name three things you can see, three things you can hear, and three parts of your body. By focusing your attention on your immediate environment rather than your feelings of stress, it can help distract and calm feelings of anxiety. There are many possibleGAD symptoms. Some people will experience most of them while others will have just a few. Some of your anxiety symptoms might be mild and fairly easy for you to cope with, while others might be intense and even make it difficult for you to function in your day-to-day life. A person who has generalized anxiety disorder experiences worry that is persistent, excessive, and intrusive. Some people develop GAD during childhood while others don't have symptoms until they are adults. Regardless of when it starts, people often experience GAD as a lifelong condition. Often used interchangeably with psychological disorder, mental illness, and psychiatric disorder, a mental disorder is the official term used in the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) DSM-5 manual. The APA indicates that a mental disorder is a noticeable disturbance in a person’s emotions, behaviors, or thinking patterns that impacts their quality of life. An anxiety disorder is a serious mental health issue that causes a person to feel excessive fear, anxiety, or worry along with other related symptoms and behaviors.2﻿ Because these fears will generally not go away on their own, they may get worse over time and can interfere with daily activities without treatment. Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, is a process used to treat a variety of mental health issues and emotional difficulties. Through different techniques and methods, a psychotherapist will help a client address psychological and life issues. While there are many approaches to psychotherapy, the overall goal is to help clients decrease symptoms and improve their functioning and well-being. A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder that involves a persistent, excessive, and irrational fear of something like a situation, activity, object, person, or animal. Typically, people with phobias try to avoid the source of their fear; or if they cannot avoid the situation, they endure it with intense fear or anxiety.

https://www.verywellmind.com/gad-in-children-20759,dynamic,Mental Health,GAD in Children,"Ann-Louise T. Lockhart, PsyD, ABPP, is a board-certified pediatric psychologist, parent coach, author, speaker, and owner of A New Day Pediatric Psychology, PLLC. Brief separation anxiety and fears of the dark, strangers,loud noises, and storms are common, normal childhood experiences. However, consistent anxiety over a wide variety of settings, groups, and objects can indicate childhoodgeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD).1 As a parent or caregiver, don't let the possibility alarm you. A diagnosis puts you and your child one step closer to the resources available—and to an improved quality of life. Approximately 15% to 20% of youth in the general population have anxiety disorders.2Amongchildren with ADHD, the rate is even higher. As with adults who experience generalized anxiety disorder, girls are twice as likely as boys to be diagnosed with GAD. Because of this, experts recommend routine anxiety screening for girls (and women) over the age of 13.3 Generalized anxiety disorder in childhood involves excessive, unrealistic worry and fear about everyday things. The child often anticipates disaster or worst-case scenarios and experiences symptoms such as:4 The effects of chronic stress are debilitating, affecting multiple areas of the child's life. Just getting through the day can be a struggle. A child may recognize their anxiety is exaggerated and still experience great difficulty controlling or managing it. TheDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(5th edition), often referred to as theDSM-5, outlines specific criteria for a GAD diagnosis. The symptoms must be experienced for at least six months. To make sure that your child is diagnosed and cared for effectively, consult a trained mental health provider to assess them. Some providers work specifically with children or those with anxiety disorders. No single cause of generalized anxiety disorder in children or adults has been determined. Children who have experienced challenging life situations or maltreatment may be at greater risk for developing GAD.4﻿ These experiences can leave children feeling uncertain of people and their surroundings, unsafe, and out of control of their environment. It is common for people of all ages who have been through experiences of challenge, loss, humiliation, or abandonment to feel anxious in future situations of uncertainty—children are no different. Puberty brings additional stressors and self-consciousness that can add to anxiety.5Frustrations and repeated difficulties with social relationships and academic performance can lead to increased anxiety around peers, as well as fears about letting down parents or teachers. These feelings are normal. However, if they interfere with your child's daily activities and don't subside with time, there may be cause for concern. Avariety of factorscan influence the development and onset of GAD, including genetic predisposition, family dynamics, life experiences, and neurobiological factors. Every treatment plan for childhood generalized anxiety disorder is tailored to the individual. There are a variety of options. Psychotherapeutic interventions are important in treating childhood generalized anxiety disorder. Counseling offers children a place to share their worries without fear of judgment, rejection, or feeling dismissed.4A trained mental health clinician can help your child with: As a caregiver, you and your family will likely be asked to participate in your child's treatment. The counseling professional will use this time to help educate parents about childhood generalized anxiety disorder, suggest helpful techniques, and allow time for the family to process together some of the child's anxious thoughts and feelings in an effective, healthy way. For mild to moderate childhood GAD symptoms, medication may not be necessary. If they're moderate to severe, however, your provider may suggestmedication.6 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for children and adolescents with anxiety. SSRIs include: As with all medications, prescriptions used to treat anxiety have risks. Your child's physician or psychiatrist will prescribe them if they believe the benefits outweigh those risks. Proven coping techniques can help ease the uncomfortable symptoms of childhood anxiety. Learning what works best for your child is key. Explain that it's time to explore some GAD management strategies. Help your child decide which ones to try, and encourage them to say what helps and what doesn't. Here are a few to start with. Anxiety keeps us focused on the ""what ifs"" of the future and can rob us of the opportunity to live in the present. Slowing the process down with intentional and peaceful action can be helpful. There are a variety of mindfulness exercises, prayers,meditations, progressive relaxation, andbreathing exercisesavailable that can help slow down your child's anxious thoughts and emotional responses.7﻿ Anxiety can make children and teens want to isolate themselves from peers and family members. Help your child feel safe to connect with others, offering opportunities to be with family and enjoy each other's company by playing games, spending time outdoors together, or finding a common interest or hobby. Volunteering in the community can be another wonderful way to help your child stay connected to others. Allow them to explore and identify something they feel passionate about and help them seek out related opportunities in the community to help. Sleep routines, eating habits, and physical activity all contribute to your child's well-being.1﻿ Your child might struggle in a certain area like sleep or physical activity, especially if they experience restlessness, muscle tension, or fatigue due to their anxiety. Helping your child create a self-care plan can improve their ability to cope with anxiety and learn to manage stress. A first step in helping your child manage and overcome anxiety is recognizing it, but this can be difficult. Children struggling with GAD can sometimes be quiet, shy, and cautious. They may be very compliant and eager to please adults. On the other hand, an anxious child may ""act out"" with tantrums, crying, avoidance, and disobedience. These behaviors may be misinterpreted asoppositionaland ""difficult."" As a caregiver, it is important to be aware of some of the ways severe anxiety can show up in children. With an increased understanding of generalized anxiety disorder, you will be better able to intervene early and find the necessary help. Early intervention and treatment can make a world of difference for your child and can prevent further complications. If you have concerns or questions about possible symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in your child, talk with your pediatrician or mental health professional. To help your child with generalized anxiety disorder, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

Everyone experiences anxiety. But people withgeneralized anxiety disorder(GAD) are frequently distracted by their worries, avoidant of activities that might stir up the anxiety, and ""on edge"" without explanation. In most cases of GAD, the anxiety negatively impacts the individual’s relationships and/or performance at school or work. Treatment for GADaims to help people feel better mentally and physically and to increase engagement with the people, places, and situations that previously elicited worry. Given the far-reaching effect that anxiety can have on day-to-day functioning, evenlow-grade anxietythat does not meet the threshold for a firm diagnosis can be worth working on. This episode ofThe Verywell Mind Podcast, featuring radio host Charlamagne Tha God, shares how to manage anxiety. Click below to listen now. Subscribe Now:Apple Podcasts/Spotify/Google Podcasts Psychotherapy is a popular form of treatment for GAD. ""Talk therapy"" can be performed by avariety of mental health professionals, and though the approaches described below can overlap, they are guided by differing theories and emphases. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) is the gold standard of psychotherapy1﻿ and one of the most popular treatments for GAD. Proven to work for adults2﻿ just as effectively as it does for younger patients,3﻿ CBT focuses on present difficulties and current situations. CBT is typically a short-term, structured treatment that focuses on the interplay between the conscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that perpetuate anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Acceptance and Commitment Therapy(ACT) is another present- and problem-focused talk therapy used to treat GAD. Although similar to CBT, the goal of ACT is to reduce the struggle to control anxious thoughts or uncomfortable sensations and increase involvement in meaningful activities that align with chosen life values. ACT can produce symptom improvement in people with GAD, and may be a particularly good fit forolder adults.4﻿ Other Talk Therapies Two other types of ""talk therapy""—psychodynamic therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy—can also be used in the treatment of GAD. Psychodynamic psychotherapy, also known as insight-oriented therapy, is based on the idea that thoughts and emotions that are outside of our consciousness (i.e., outside of our awareness) can lead to internal conflict and manifest as anxiety. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a time-limited, present-focused treatment based on the assumption that symptoms may be caused or maintained by problems in relationships, and that resolving these problems can help reduce symptoms. Medications for anxiety work by interacting with brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Particular medications may block the absorption or enhance the action of one or more of these chemicals. Thedifferent types of medications usedin the treatment of anxiety include: Also, another ""older"" category of antidepressants—monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)—are sometimes used. Antidepressants have a well-documented ability to help with GAD symptoms, but they can take several weeks to take effect. SSRIs, such as sertraline (Zoloft) or fluoxetine (Prozac), are typically considered a good, first-line choice for the treatment of GAD because they are relatively safe medications that tend to be well tolerated by individuals. Anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, do not treat the underlying cause of anxiety, but they are effective in the treatment of symptoms. However, this class of medication has some notable drawbacks, including potential side effects like sedation and a tendency to be habit-forming. Buspirone (Buspar) is one medication in this class that is approved for the treatment of GAD and is not known to be habit-forming. There is some evidence that buspirone may also help augment antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants are an older type of antidepressants that are used less commonly because they may carry some potentially significant side effects. Self-help refers to less formal approaches that address anxiety symptoms with limited (or no) guidance. For example, there areseveral self-help booksthat provide help in a step-by-step format and closely mirror evidence-based psychotherapies for GAD, such as CBT or ACT. With the advent of smartphone technology and the rising popularity of interactive applications, there are now alsoelectronic self-help optionsthat deliver programs informed by evidence-based GAD treatment. There are also applications available with circumscribed, do-it-yourself anxiety-busting tools, likerelaxation techniques and mindfulness meditation exercises. Speaking with a clinician—a physician or mental health provider—is the best way to figure out next step(s). Depending on the nature and extent of the anxiety symptoms, one or a combination of the approaches described above may be useful. In general, mild or intermittent anxiety may improve with the use self-help resources. Self-help resources are also a good option for those wishing to pursue an evidence-based psychotherapy who lack access to specialized care. Self-help options can also be used in conjunction with ongoing treatment, or to prevent relapse and promote continued progress after the conclusion of a course of psychotherapy. If your symptoms are persistent, are impacting your day-to-day functioning and/or the important relationships in your life, or are clearly noticeable to others, then more formal treatment is worth considering. For anxiety of a moderate to a severe degree, a course of psychotherapy may be indicated. Medications can help with persistent anxiety of any degree. When considering psychotherapy versus medication, it is important to note that psychotherapy may take longer to bring symptom relief than medication, but its effects can also be longer lasting (i.e., the insight and skills learned in psychotherapy are retained after treatment ends). And for some individuals with GAD, maximizing treatment—taking medication and participating in psychotherapy—maximizes results. Making the decision that’s right for you is really a process of ongoing assessment. If you select a self-help approach, be aware that persistent or worsening symptoms are indicators that you would benefit from an in-person evaluation by a clinician. With medication or psychotherapy treatment, find a provider you trust and ask questions to fully understand what type of treatment you will be receiving as well as its risks and benefits (You can read more on deciding if medication is right for you here). When pursuing treatment of any kind, it is important to be patient and to participate in regular monitoring of symptoms (and, in the case of medication treatment, side effects) with your clinician. A Word From Verywell While the symptoms associated with GAD are undeniably uncomfortable, the good news is that they are treatable. The treatments described above will take work, but the work will pay off in the form of relief and respite from anxiety and worry.

https://www.verywellmind.com/anti-anxiety-medications-2330663,dynamic,Mental Health,Anti-Anxiety Medications,"Anxiety treatments and lifestyle techniques can help you manage symptoms Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Verywell / Cindy Chung If you have persistent anxiety that affects your life on a recurrent basis, your symptoms may be caused by ananxiety disorder. Often, anxiety disorders are treatable with medication, counseling, andtherapy techniquessuch ascognitive behavioral therapy. There are also a number of lifestyle methods that you can use to reduce your anxiety level. If you have anxiety, medication can help because the medicines used for anxiety alter the chemicals in your body and brain, reducing symptoms, and often helping you calm down and focus on other things. Other approaches to symptom relief, such as counseling and developing relaxation techniques, can also reduce your anxiety. Often, a combination of approaches is needed to alleviate symptoms of anxiety. This article discusses some of the different types of medicine for anxiety and how they can help. It also covers other treatment options that can help, including talk therapy and lifestyle modifications. Anti-anxiety medicationshave physical effects on the brain and the body, which can help reduce the symptoms of anxiety, such as worry, fear, and panic attacks. These medications must be prescribed by a doctor, and often by a psychiatrist. Anti-anxiety medications are not cures for anxiety disorders, but they can help manage some of the symptoms. There are a number of different anti-anxiety medications available, and the right medication for you depends on your type of anxiety disorder and whether you have other health problems or take other medications. Medications may be prescribed on-label (meaning they are FDA approved to treat a specific condition) or off-label (meaning they have not been FDA-approved for a particular condition). FDA-approved medications to treat anxiety include SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, benzodiazepines, and hydroxyzine. Your doctor may prescribe another medication off-label if they think it is the best option to treat your condition. Benzodiazepines such asValium(diazepam),Xanax(alprazolam),Klonopin(clonazepam) and Ativan (lorazepam) are sometimes used to treat anxiety for a short-term period. They are used for generalized anxiety disorder and may be used as a second-line treatment for panic disorder and social anxiety disorder, with antidepressants being the front-line choices.1 Benzodiazepines induce muscle relaxation and reduce other symptoms related to anxiety. These medications are not typically used long-term because they can be habit-forming and may lead to dependence or addiction. Beta blockers are used to control heart disease. They help reduce your heart rate and blood pressure by blocking the effects of epinephrine, a stimulant that your body naturally produces. Beta-blockers can help control trembling, sweating, and other physical symptoms of anxiety. They may be prescribed off-label for the short term when used for anxiety. Sectral (acebutolol), Tenormin (atenolol), Inderal LA (propranolol), are a few beta-blockers. Common side effects include weight gain, fatigue, and cold hands and feet. Beta-blockers are not recommended if you have asthma or diabetes.2 BuSpar(buspirone) may be prescribed for long-term treatment of chronic anxiety, and it's recognized as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. It increases the action of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps improve mood and reduce anxiety. Buspar takes one to two weeks for initial effects to be felt and can take four to six weeks for the full effect. Because of this, it is not considered effective for the treatment of anxiety attacks, and it must be taken consistently in order to have an effect on symptoms. It is less sedating than many of the other commonly used anti-anxiety medications, and it is non-addictive and has a low risk of overdose. Possible side effects include dizziness, headache, nervousness, and trouble sleeping.3 Buspirone can affect blood glucose levels, so it should be used with caution if you have diabetes. It should not be used by people with a known hypersensitivity to buspirone hydrochloride.4 Often used as a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) include medications like Paxil (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline) and Lexapro (escitalopram). SSRIs are considered antidepressants and they increase the amount of serotonin in the brain, which helps improve mood. Side effects include headaches, dry mouth, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction, diminished sex drive, and weight gain. As with many antidepressants, they can increase the risk of suicidal ideation (thinking about or planning suicide), particularly in children,teenagers, and young adults.5 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat988for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. Another common category of medications used for anxiety are theserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors(SNRIs), which are antidepressants, and include medications like Effexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta (duloxetine), and Pristiq (desvenlafaxine). SNRIs increase the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine to help boost mood and are similar in effectiveness to SSRIs. Side effects are similar to those of SSRIs.6 Tricyclic antidepressantsare also used in treating anxiety. Common medications in this class are Tofranil (imipramine), Elavil (amitriptyline), Pamelor (nortriptyline) and Anafranil (clomipramine). Side effects may include constipation, dry mouth, blurry vision, a decrease in blood pressure when standing, and urinary retention (decreased ability to urinate).7 All of the anti-anxiety medications have side effects, and they can have serious adverse events if they are overused or used incorrectly. Many of them can affect your heart rate, blood pressure, and level of alertness. They may cause loss of consciousness or even death when used in excessive amounts, in combination with other medications that interact with the central nervous system, or with alcohol or recreational drugs. Many of the antidepressants that are used for anxiety can also induce suicidal ideation. There are no over-the-counter treatments (OTC) for anxiety; however, some people find that OTC options help ease their anxiety symptoms. It's important to note that the long-term effects of many herbal remedies are not well known and that the following supplements may interact with other medications and produce undesirable effects. Be sure to talk to a doctor before starting a new supplement. The extract of ashwagandha is used in pills and usually advertised as helping to reduce anxiety and stress. While some research found ashwagandha reduced depression, stress, and anxiety in a small group of adults, more studies are needed to understand its effects on anxiety in the long term.8 L-theanine is an amino acid that is sold in supplement form. One study found that 200 milligrams per day of L-theanine in healthy adults reduced stress and anxiety and improved sleep quality.9 However, more research is needed to understand what dosage is most effective as well as L-theanine's effects on people with chronic anxiety symptoms.10 Valerian root is an herb that is often used in teas or tinctures to reduce anxiety and/or improve sleep quality. However, high doses of valerian root may actually make anxiety symptoms worse.11Potential side effects include headaches, nausea, and heart palpitations. In people who experience anxiety as a result of magnesium deficiency, adding a magnesium supplement may help reduce symptoms.12 While some studies suggest that certain supplements may improve anxiety, more research is needed. Do not use supplements as a substitute for seeking treatment for anxiety symptoms. Medications can help relieve symptoms of anxiety, but they are often most effective when used along with psychotherapy. A mental health professional can help you treat your symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)is considered a first-line treatment for anxiety. Research has found that CBT can be effective for treating social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobias, panic disorder, and other types of anxiety.13 In CBT, a trained professional helps you identify the specific coping strategy and lifestyle changes that can help you manage your symptoms.

https://www.verywellmind.com/breaking-the-anxiety-cycle-1392987,dynamic,Mental Health,Breaking the Anxiety Cycle,"Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Verywell / Laura Porter Anxiety is something that everyone experiences from time to time, but for some people, it can become pervasive and excessive.Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)is characterized by persistent, excessive worry. If the problem started and ended with a single worry, it might not be such a big deal. Instead, people with GAD get bogged down as one worry leads to another and another.1 Some people tend to be more prone to anxiety, often due to upbringing orgenetics, but there are also other factors at work that can contribute to the anxiety cycle. Such things include: In some cases, people withanxiety problems have difficulty recallingdata that is inconsistent with a particular worry. Anxiety can have a number of distressing effects on your health and well-being. Some of these include: Intrusive, anxious thoughts can create distress and make it difficult to cope. Take, for example, this worry: ""My boyfriend is going to break up with me."" This is an intrusive thought that is actually quite normal for a person to have. It might come up out of the blue or in response to a specific situation. Need a breather? Take this free5-minute meditation focused on relieving anxiety—or choose from ourguided meditation libraryto find another one that will help you feel your best. However, an overlyanxious personwould appraise this thought as very meaningful, review all the reasons why this thought might be true, try to reduce the anxiety in the short term (effectively strengthening it in the long term), and become very stressed by it. As a result, the belief becomes even more significant and is experienced more frequently and more intensely than in someone without an anxiety problem.1To overcome anxiety, this vicious cycle needs to be broken. There are different ways that you may be able to overcome anxiety in order to enjoy better emotional wellness. The following are some strategies you might try to include. One way to overcome anxiety is to learn to accept that not every intrusive thought is signaling a legitimate reason to worry. Simply put, not every thought is true. So it's often unhelpful to try to disprove the beliefs. Try an acceptance-based approach instead, which includes:5 An acceptance-based approach means that you observe the thought you're having without the urgency you might normally feel to address it, fix it, argue with it, or believe it. You are letting it come and go without focusing on it. Cognitive restructuringis another strategy that can help you change the way you perceive situations and lessen your anxiety. This technique is a cornerstone of a treatment approach called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Cognitive restructuring offers a way to critically evaluate potentially distorted thoughts,6like ""He’s definitely going to break up with me."" You ask a series of questions about the belief that can encourage a more balanced view. For instance, ""He's definitely going to break up with me,"" might turn into a more realistic belief such as, ""Just because we had a small argument doesn't mean our relationship will end."" The basic concept of exposure is to lean into anxiety by confronting, rather than avoiding, anxiety-provoking situations to learnby experience.You learn that nothing terrible will happen, or that bad outcomes are manageable (and might even have an upside).6 When facing a fear, it is critical to refrain from any safety behaviors that might ""undo"" learning; this is sometimes referred to as response prevention. For instance, an exposure exercise could be intentionally disagreeing with a boyfriend or imagining what it would be like to get into a major argument. Repetition helps with exposure, so repeating an exposure until it all becomes more boring than anxiety-provoking can be important.6 The response prevention component would be to do these thingsand not ask whether or not your boyfriend is mad, so as to learn to live with uncertainty. While the cycle of anxiety is often vicious, breaking even one link can go a long way to diminishing worry and the anxiety to which it leads. Research shows that anxiety levels can be impacted by the kinds offoods and drinksyou consume. One study observed that participants who consumed more saturated fats and added sugars had higher anxiety levels than those who consumed fewer fats and less sugar.7 Eating fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and high-fiber foods—while limiting processed foods—is connected with improving mood and making it easier to manage psychiatric conditions likeanxiety and depression.8 Caffeine can also increase your anxiety levels.9If you drink more than one cup of coffee per day, try scaling back or eliminate it altogether and note whether your anxiety improves. Caffeine is also in many teas, beverages, and foods (like chocolate) so make sure to read nutrition labels to monitor how much you're consuming. Find a way to move your body that feels good—it doesn't have to be a long and arduous workout. Taking a walk for even 10 minutes can help improve your mood.10 Exercise can improve your concentration, your sleep, and lower your stress levels. Many doctors advisephysical exercisealongside therapy and/or medication for people with anxiety and depression. Other coping strategies you can try to help ease anxiety include practicing techniques such as mindfulness, meditation,deep breathing, andprogressive muscle relaxation. One study, for example, found that people who practiced a technique known as mindfulness meditation experienced significant reductions in stress and anxiety.11 Connecting with nature is another way to improve your anxiety. Studies find that using any of the five senses to feel closer to nature—taking a walk in the woods or even listening to nature sounds—can boost your mood and puts you in a more relaxed state.12 Beyond generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety can also be a symptom of a number of other disorders includingphobias, panic disorder, andsocial anxiety disorder. It's important to recognize that you are not alone: Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental health conditions in the U.S. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 19.1% of U.S. adults experienced some type of anxiety disorder during the past year and more than 30% of adults will have an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives.13 If anxiety is causing distress and disruptions in your normal functioning, it is important to get help. Treatments for anxiety typically rely onpsychotherapy,medications, or a combination of the two. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms in order to determine what approach to treatment might work best for you. If you or a loved one are struggling with anxiety, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

https://www.verywellmind.com/marijuana-and-anxiety-1393132,dynamic,Mental Health,Marijuana and Anxiety,"Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Verywell / Cindy Chung Marijuana has been used as an herbal remedy for thousands of years. Today, marijuana is more widely legalized in the United States for medicinal and recreational use. Researchers have also begun to explore how compounds found in marijuana, including THC and CBD, might affect mental health conditions such as anxiety. Research suggests that low doses of THC may produce a subjective sense of anxiety relief. However, higher doses tend to increase negative mood.1While THC may have some possible beneficial mental health applications, there are still potentialnegative side effects of marijuanato consider. It is also important to note that this research is still in its early stages. While some states have legalized marijuana or some cannabis-derived products, it is still illegal on the federal level. This article covers what you need to know about THC for anxiety, including its effects and risks. It also explores the risk of addiction as well as alternative treatment options for managing anxiety. No cannabis-derived products are FDA-approved to treat anxiety or other mental health conditions.2However, some research has suggested that the compounds found in cannabis, including THC and CBD, may offer some mental health benefits. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that CBD could be helpful in the treatment of anxiety and addiction.3However, more research is needed before any cannabis product can be recommended to treat anxiety. However, this hasn't stopped consumers from turning to THC and other cannabis products to relieve anxiety. According to one review, 50% of people who use medical marijuana do so to reduce anxiety symptoms.4 Two of the main compounds in cannabis—tetrahydrocannabinol(THC) andcannabidiol(CBD)—are linked with potential therapeutic effects for anxiety. THC is the psychoactive compound in cannabis. THC is linked with feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and sociability in low doses.5 Medical marijuana is sometimes used for panic attacks. However, in high doses, THC may induce panic attacks in some people.5 Scientists at Washington State University published a study in theJournal of Affective Disordersthat found that smoking cannabis can significantly reduce self-reported levels of depression and stress in the short term.6 Although, repeated use doesn't seem to lead to any long-term reduction of symptoms, and in some individuals, it may increase depression over time. Cannabis may provide relief for physical pain—particularly among adults with chronic or neuropathic pain (caused by damaged nerves). More research is needed to compare marijuana's effectiveness in relieving pain compared to other options.7 Studies show that short-term cannabis use may lengthen the time a person is able to stay asleep. THC and/or CBD may help some fall asleep earlier and wake up fewer times during the night.8 People who struggle to fall or stay sleep due to their anxiety may self-medicate with cannabis to try toimprove their sleep. However, cannabis doesn't improve sleep for everyone. Marijuana can affect your body in many ways beyond just getting you high. Thehigh feeling you may experience after smokingor ingesting marijuana is due to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical compound that gives marijuana its psychoactive effects. The effects of THC do not come without risks, and long-term or frequent use has been associated with several potential side effects.9 Various studies have found that young adults who self-medicate with marijuana actually have higher rates of: While depression may trigger someone to use cannabis to relieve their symptoms, studies found that higher cannabis use is linked with worsened depression symptoms. More research is needed to understand whether cannabis may cause depression or increase the risk of depression.15 Some research has shown that heavy use of marijuana in adolescents (particularly in teenage girls) can be a predictor of anxiety and depression—and increase the risk ofsuicide—later in life.16 Certain susceptible individuals that use high-potency marijuana regularly may also be at a greater risk of developingpsychosislater on.17 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat988for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. The central problem with using marijuana as an anxiety coping tool is that it can create a psychological dependence on the substance. People may come to rely on marijuana because its effects are fast-acting; however, this may make some less likely to develop long-term behavior-based coping strategies that are more sustainable over time. Several studies have found that long-term marijuana use can cause memory loss. Memory impairment occurs because THC alters one of the areas of the brain, thehippocampus, responsible for memory formation.18 People predisposed to higher levels of anxiety may be more likely to experience the negative effects of THC (i.e.,dysphoriaor panic).5 THC can raise your heart rate, which, if you have anxiety, may make you feel even more anxious. Using too much marijuana can also make you feel scared,paranoid, or disconnected from reality. Cannabis can also cause feelings of dizziness, nausea, confusion, and blurred vision, which can contribute to anxiety. A rare consequence of frequent marijuana use, particularly with today’s more potent strains, is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This involves cyclical nausea and vomiting.19 This is paradoxical and can be difficult to diagnose, as marijuana has been used to decrease nausea and vomiting in cancer treatment. Those who have CHS sometimes find relief in hot baths and showers, but ultimately, abstinence from marijuana is necessary for long-term improvement. You can develop atoleranceto marijuana. This means that the more you use it, the more you will eventually need to use to get the same effects that you previously experienced. Cannabis use disorder(also known as marijuana use disorder) is considered an addiction to cannabis in which a person cannot stop using the drug despite its negative impact on life. Signs of cannabis use disorder include:20 Research suggests that around 30% of people who use marijuana will develop a cannabis use disorder. This risk is four to seven times higher for people who start using marijuana prior to the age of 18.21 Those who use marijuana heavily may find that if they try to cut back or stop using altogether, they experience symptoms of cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS), which include:15 Unfortunately, marijuana use may cause potentially dangerous physical effects such as:18 When you use a substance to treat or cope with a medical problem or symptom without the supervision of a medical professional, it is calledself-medicating. Self-medicating often produces an immediate relief of uncomfortable symptoms, reinforcing its use. People will continue to self-medicate with a substance that temporarily relieves symptoms, even when the substance itself causes unpleasant side effects. Over time, it may be challenging to stop self-medicating despite these side effects. This can also increase a person's risk for dependence and addiction. Not enough is known about marijuana's efficacy for particular medical conditions and its long-term consequences to be considered a safe treatment option. While statistics suggest people often use medical marijuana to relieve anxiety, it is not without risks. Marijuana is associated with a higher risk for psychiatric disorders, dependence and addiction, memory loss, increased anxiety, cardiovascular effects, and withdrawal symptoms. Some states have legalized the use of medical marijuana to treat a diagnosed anxiety disorder. The states and territories that have approved this use are: A few other states, including California, New Hampshire, and Missouri, allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana treatments at their discretion. While some states have legalized marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, any product containing more than 0.3% THC is still considered illegal according to federal law. Remember that some level of anxiety is normal and even helpful when you are confronted with something that feels threatening to you. However, when feeling anxious becomes pervasive and challenging to control, it is best to seek professional help to discuss other forms of anxiety management. Proactive coping strategies, learned through counseling, support groups, as well as self-help books, and educational websites, can create lasting change without the negative components of extended marijuana use. You may work with a doctor to develop a treatment plan that is right for you. Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) and other forms of therapy can help you determine the underlying cause of your anxiety and manage it more effectively.22You may work with a doctor to develop a treatment plan that is right for you. Working with a psychotherapist to manage your anxiety can give you a better handle on your condition in the long run. The use of certain prescription medications such asselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) has been firmly established as a safe and effective treatment for anxiety disorders.23 Prescription medication is also preferable to marijuana since thelong-term riskshave been better studied and are potentially less significant compared to long-term marijuana use. Some anti-anxiety medications are taken daily, while others are taken episodically during periods of extreme anxiety or during a panic attack. A psychiatrist or primary care doctor may prescribe anti-anxiety medications, should you need one. Suppose you have been using marijuana or other THC-based products to relieve anxiety and feel that you might be dependent or addicted to these substances. In that case, there are treatments available that can help. Cannabis use disorder is often treated with talk therapy, which can help you address patterns that contribute to substance use, increase your motivation to quit, and strengthen your ability to cope with stress. Common types of therapy that are often used to treat cannabis use disorder include:24 There are no FDA-approved medications to treat cannabis use disorder.25However, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat co-occurring mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression.

Aron Janssen, MD is board certified in child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry and is the vice chair of child and adolescent psychiatry Northwestern University.  izusek / Getty Images All teens experience nervousness sometimes. Feeling tense before a date, worrying about an exam, and experiencing nerves before a big presentation is normal. But sometimes, teens experience so much anxiety that it impairs their daily functioning. Parents of anxious teenagers—as well as the teens themselves—are often desperate for help. How do you know when the anxiety rises to the level of requiring treatment? Or maybe you have concerns about whether anxiety medication is safe for this age group. Keep reading to learn how to tell when anxiety treatment may be necessary for teens. Also, find information about anxiety medication for teens, its potential side effects, and medication-related safety warnings. There are many different types of teen anxiety, including: Anxiety becomes problematic when it affects a teen’s social, occupational, or educational functioning. Here are a few examples of when a teen may benefit from anxiety treatment: Other signs that a teen might be experiencing symptoms of anxiety include: Approximately 60% of young people with an anxiety disorder don’t get treatment.1But anxietyistreatable. Along withcognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—also known as talk therapy—medication is also an effective teen anxiety treatment. Prescription medicationscan be useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. They are also often used in conjunction with CBT. Research studies show that a combination of CBT and medication works better for children than either treatment alone.2That said, when teens have mild to moderate functional impairments, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends deferring the use of medication.3 As with all medications, prescriptions used to treat anxiety have risks. They are prescribed, however, when a physician thinks that the benefits offered by the medication outweigh those risks. It can be challenging to find the right anxiety medication that will work for your teen. Here are a few that a physician may prescribe. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)are the most commonly prescribed medication for anxiety in children and teens. They improve mood by blocking the reabsorption ofserotonin—a neurotransmitter that helps regulate fear, worry, and stress—in the brain.3 Common SSRIs used to treat anxiety disorders in teens include: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be prescribed if SSRIs don't have the desired effect. Like SSRIs, SNRIs impact neurotransmitters in the brain. They block the reabsorption of serotonin and norepinephrine. SNRIs may include medications such as: These types of medications can take up to eight weeks to work. If a teen tolerates the medication well but hasn't received the desired results, the dosage may be increased after several weeks. Although SSRIs and SNRIs are most commonly used to treat anxiety in teens, other prescriptions may be used as well.Benzodiazepinesare the second most commonly used type of medication4and may be prescribed to teens with severe anxiety. Medications in this category include: Benzodiazepines are usually short-term treatments and are less commonly prescribed because they carry some additional risks. For example, teens may grow dependent on them, and benzodiazepines may be misused. Stopping them suddenly could also lead towithdrawal symptomsor even seizures.3 Occasionally, physicians may prescribe other medications off-label to treat anxiety. This might include prescribing drugs such asantihistamines, non-SSRI antidepressants, hydroxyzine, or atypical antipsychotics.4The exact medication prescribed can vary based on the teen's diagnosis, the severity of the anxiety, and other factors. Examples of medications that may be prescribed include: There are a number of medications that have been approved to treat anxiety in adults, but only Cymbalta (duloxetine) has been FDA-approved to treat generalized anxiety disorder in children ages seven and up.5However, a number of other medications are also prescribed ""off-label"" to treat childhood anxiety. Off-label prescribing is common. It means that doctors use their knowledge and discretion to recommend treatments that, while safe and effective, have not gone through the FDA-approval process for a specific indication.6 Many teens don’t experience side effects when taking SSRIs or SNRIs. Those that do often find that the effects are mild and usually go away within the first few weeks of treatment.3 The most common side effects of SSRI and SNRI anxiety medications for teens include: Other possible side effects may include: Parents and physicians should discuss potential side effects with teens so they know what to expect and can report any side effects they are experiencing. If one medication isn't working or causing serious side effects, your teen may need to change medications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in 2004 that antidepressant medications often used to treat adolescent anxiety (such as many SSRIs and SNRIs) may increasesuicidal thoughts and behaviorin a small number of children and adolescents.7 No suicides were reported in the studies that led to the warnings. However, in clinical trials, the rate of suicidal thinking or suicidal behavior was 4% among patients receiving an antidepressant compared with 2% receiving a placebo. Research shows that warnings against antidepressant use for teens may have actually backfired. Prior to the FDA warnings (1990-2002), suicide deaths decreased substantially. Following the warnings (2005-2017), there was an abrupt decline in treatments, yet suicide deaths increased markedly.8 To address this concern, a black box warning was added to these medications. Critics of this warning fear that some children and teens may not get the help they need for fear that the medications are unsafe. To combat the added risk for adolescents, parents and teens are educated about the potential risks, and teens are monitored closely with frequent appointments. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat988for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. It is not uncommon for anxiety to co-occur alongside other mental health conditions. In some instances, other conditions may contribute to symptoms of anxiety. Conditions that are associated with anxiety in children and teens include: Each teen's situation is different. Medications will sometimes be prescribed to treat co-occurring conditions, which may play a role in alleviating feelings of anxiety in some cases. If your teen is struggling with anxiety, consult a healthcare provider. Describe your concerns and ask about treatment options. While some primary care physicians and pediatricians feel comfortable prescribing anti-anxiety medications to teens, others may refer children and adolescents to a psychiatrist.Psychiatristsare specialist physicians who treat mental health disorders. If you have concerns about your teen’s diagnosis or treatment plan, seek a second opinion. Talking to another professional can help you decide on the best course of action. With the right treatment and monitoring, teens can find relief from anxiety. Medications may be a part of this treatment, but other strategies, including talk therapy, behavioral interventions, and lifestyle modifications, can also be helpful. The answer to this question is not quite clear. Some herbal remedies have been found to help treat anxiety.9However, many of these studies have been conducted only on adult subjects. A 2018 study involving 80 teens did find that those taking a saffron extract for eight weeks had greater improvements in their anxiety than a control group.10But researchers also noted that these effects were not necessarily corroborated by the teens' parents. Consult a healthcare provider before trying to treat a teen's anxiety with natural medications or products. Signs of teen anxiety include excessively worrying, continuous nervousness, and restlessness. You may also notice that the teen is withdrawn or uncomfortable in social situations. Teen anxiety can sometimes manifest physically, appearing in the form of muscle cramps, stomach issues, headaches, and fatigue. An anxious teen may even sweat, tremble, or startle easily.11 If your teen's anxiety is impacting their everyday life, they may benefit from anxiety medication. It's also beneficial to recognize the difference between normal anxiety and a potential anxiety disorder. Signs of an anxiety disorder in teens that may benefit from anxiety medications include anxiety that begins before puberty, anxiety in situations that wouldn't normally provoke anxious feelings, unexplained physical symptoms, consistent anxiety symptoms, and avoidance of certain situations.6 Roughly three in 10 kids with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also have anxiety.12If your teen has this dual diagnosis, both medication and behavioral treatment can help. Talk to a healthcare provider about the best options for them based on their anxiety type and severity. Talking to the teen's school may also help, such as getting them support in and out of the classroom.

https://www.verywellmind.com/acceptance-commitment-therapy-gad-1393175,dynamic,Therapies,Acceptance Commitment Therapy,"How ACT Therapy Works Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Steve Debenport / E+ / Getty Images Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a type ofpsychotherapythat emphasizes acceptance to deal with negative thoughts, feelings, symptoms, or circumstances. ACT therapy encourages increased commitment to healthy, constructive activities that uphold your values or goals. ""Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive-behavioral therapy approach that focuses on helping people accept difficult thoughts, feelings, sensations, and internal experiences while guiding them to commit to values-based actions,"" explainsAvigail Lev, PsyD, a licensed clinical psychologist who specializes in acceptance-based treatments. ACT therapists operate under a theory that suggests that increasing acceptance can lead to increasedpsychological flexibility.1This approach carries a host of benefits, and it may help people stophabitually avoidingspecific thoughts or emotional experiences, which can lead to further problems. We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of thebest online therapy programsincluding Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. Unlikecognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the goal of ACT is not to reduce the frequency or severity of unpleasant internal experiences like upsettingcognitive distortions, emotions, or urges. Rather, the goal is to reduce your struggle to control or eliminate these experiences while increasing your involvement in meaningful life activities (i.e., those that are consistent with your personal values). ""ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) utilizes six processes to help people create psychological flexibility, meaning the freedom to choose our actions regardless of our internal experiences, "" Lev explains. She describes the six processes of ACT therapy as:2 These are the areas of your life that are important enough to you to motivate action. It is about recognizing what you want to be about and stand for. This process involves changing your behavior based on principles covered in therapy. These specific actions can either move us closer or further toward our values. This involves learning to see your thoughts about yourself as separate from your actions. By doing so, people can make space for their thoughts and feelings without becoming entangled with them, Lev says. One metaphor asks the client to think of themselves as the sky and their thoughts and feelings as weather patterns. While the weather can shift from clear to stormy, the sky remains the same despite the fleeting nature of the weather. ""This metaphor conveys that thoughts and feelings are transient, and we don’t equal our thoughts or feelings, nor are we defined by them,"" Lev explains. Cognitive defusionis separating yourself from your inner experiences. This allows you to see thoughts simply as thoughts, stripped of the importance that your mind adds to them. Exercises that can help with this include imagining your thoughts on clouds and then watching them drift away, making connections between thoughts and values, or singing thoughts in silly voices. This means allowing your inner thoughts and feelings to occur without trying to change or ignore them. Acceptance is an active process. Specific skills that are used in ACT therapy to help clients learn acceptance include: Instead of trying to change your thoughts, Lev says, the goal is to create a non-judgemental relationship with them. ACT therapy encourages you tostay mindful of your surroundingsand learn to shift your attention away from internal thoughts and feelings. This involves a conscious and deliberate effort to focus on the world around you in the moment. Staying engaged with the present can help you build greater awareness and prevent past experiences, memories, and conditioning from negatively affecting your interactions in the here and now. Incorporating all six ACT processes helps people develop psychological flexibility and the freedom to choose their actions, even in the face of very difficult thoughts, feelings, sensations, and urges. These no longer have to be barriers to moving towards values. The first sessions of ACT therapy focus on clarify values with a client, Lev explains. Subsequent sessions then focus on helping people connect to those values and apply them in their lives. Lev explains that a typical ACT therapy session involves: During ACT, your therapist will help you apply these concepts to your life. They may teach you how to practice acceptance and cognitive defusion or help you develop a differentsense of yourselfdistinct from your thoughts and feelings. Sessions can also includemindfulness exercisesto foster non-judgmental, healthy awareness of thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories you have otherwise avoided. Your therapist may also help highlight moments when your actions didn't fit your values while helping you understand which behaviors would fit. Your therapist may assignhomeworkto practice between sessions, such as mindfulness, cognitive, or values clarification exercises. The homework is agreed upon between you and your therapist and can be modified to make it as personal and useful as possible.

Follow Now:Apple Podcasts/Spotify/Google Podcasts/Amazon Music ACT may be effective in treating:3 Research has shown that ACT can improve symptoms for people withgeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD), and it may also be a particularly good fit forolder adultswith the condition.5 One core benefit of ACT is the impact it has on psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is the ability to embrace your thoughts and feelings when they are useful and to set them aside when they are not. This allows you to respond thoughtfully to your inner experience and avoid short-term, impulsive actions, focusing instead on living a meaningful life.2 Psychological flexibility can improve your ability to accept and function with symptoms like anxiety or depression. Often, those symptoms may lessen significantly due to this increase in psychological flexibility.2 ACT therapy also helps people cultivate greaterself-awarenessandself-compassion. ""One of the primary benefits of ACT is that it helps individuals build a different relationship with their internal experiences. This means learning to relate to oneself and one's inner narrator with kindness and gentleness,"" Lev says. ACT is sometimes referred to as a ""third wave"" or ""new wave"" psychotherapy. The term ""third wave"" treatment refers to a broad spectrum of psychotherapies that also includes: ""Third-wave behavioral therapy approaches differ from traditional CBT methods because they emphasize acceptance and mindfulness-based strategies rather thancognitive restructuringwhich involves challenging and changing difficult thoughts and feelings,"" Lev explains. ""This means they focus more on helping people accept difficult emotions, developing a loving relationship with their emotions, and creating distance from troubling thoughts."" Historically, third-wave treatments were seen as appropriate for people not benefiting from pre-existing treatments like classical CBT. However, it is now believed that a third-wave therapy option may make sense as a first-line treatment for some individuals.6 Recent theories suggest that attempting to resist or change thoughts and feelings can make them stronger. So, instead of challenging them as one would in traditional CBT, ACT takes a different approach. ACT helps people change their relationship with the mind and with internal experiences so that these have less influence on their behavior. The more willing we are to stay present with difficult thoughts and feelings the more freedom we have to choose our actions and to use our emotions as a compass to help guide our decisions. Research shows ACT to be effective at treating a wide range of conditions, including some that span several diagnoses. ACT also appears to improve quality of life and may help people deal with physical conditions and chronic pain.3 While ACT is an effective treatment for a variety of conditions, research shows that it may be about as helpful as other available forms of therapy, such as CBT.7These findings suggest that someone who benefits from ACT may have also benefited from another treatment. ACT has also faced criticism for its similarity to other forms of therapy. Some proponents of CBT claim that ACT, like other third-wave therapies, doesn’t represent a significantly different approach.8 Several types of mental health professionals may offer ACT, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, or mental health counselors. If you are interested in learning more about this approach, you might ask about your treatment provider’s training background with it or seek out an experienced ACT practitioner. You may also try referral sources such as theAssociation for Contextual Behavioral Science (ACBS)or theAssociation for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT). The ACBS also providesfree resources about ACTin the form of videos, audio clips, and mindfulness exercises. A therapist specifically trained in ACT will be both an active, empathic listener and an active guide, encouraging deeper exploration and non-judgmental awareness during the sessions. ACT sessions tend to be hands-on, often including psychological exercises or mindfulness training, as well as homework after the session is done. Completing these exercises is an important part of ACT, as this is the way you can learn new skills and improve your psychological flexibility. Your therapist will also want to discuss your values and goals during therapy. This is another crucial part of treatment, as these values will inform your actions moving forward.

https://www.verywellmind.com/anxiety-and-personality-style-1392978,dynamic,Mental Health,Anxiety and Personality,"Kelly Knox / Stocksy United Anxiety disorders can be as diverse as the people they affect.How anxiety looksand feels for one person can be very different from the shape and form it takes for another. Part of the reason for these differences is that anxiety can be, in some ways, linked to individual personality. For some people, anxiety is like a little pinch thatpropels them to do somethingthey have been avoiding; while for others, it is an overwhelming crush of terror. For many, the experience of anxiety falls somewhere in between these extremes. The potential explanations for whatcauses generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)are also varied. While biological explanations usually take center stage, researchers are finding that how we experience anxiety might also be related to our learned style of dealing with our feelings and the world around us.1 Here's what you should know about how your personality might influence how you experience anxiety, as well as some tips for how to cope. Hosted by therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode ofThe Verywell Mind Podcast, featuring NBA player Kyle Guy, shares ways to reduce your anxiety. Click below to listen now. Follow Now:Apple Podcasts/Spotify/Google Podcasts A person who has generalized anxiety disorder experiences worry that is persistent, excessive, and intrusive. Some people develop GAD during childhood while others don't have symptoms until they are adults.2Regardless of when it starts, people often experience GAD as a lifelong condition. It is also not unusual for it to co-occur with other mental health conditions, such asmood disorders. Often,anxiety disorders(including GAD) can be managed with a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Certain lifestyle changes, coping skills, and relaxation techniques can also be useful for some people with GAD. There are many possibleGAD symptoms. Some people will experience most of them while others will have just a few. Some of your anxiety symptoms might be mild and fairly easy for you to cope with, while others might be intense and even make it difficult for you to function in your day-to-day life. Symptoms you might have if you have generalized anxiety include: Anxiety is not ""all in your head."" Many people also feel anxiety in their bodies. Some people have physical signs and symptoms of anxiety, such as: Mental health conditions like anxiety are usually multifactorial—which means there is not just one cause, but typically many factors, that contribute. It's believed that biological and genetic influences can have a strong influence on conditions like anxiety, but mental health professionals also tend to find that it is worth exploring how a person first learned to deal with the world to uncover additional contributing factors.7﻿ For example, if someone is taught (either directly or indirectly) that feelings of anxiety tend to encourage them to produce successful outcomes or that it is the ""default"" feeling to experience, then anxiety can easily become part of their disposition. It then will influence how they deal with work,relationships, and other aspects of their lives.8﻿ In this sense, anxiety can be thought of as apersonality traitor even a personality style. On the other hand, research has also indicated that having certain personality traits (including social inhibition, emotional instability, and introversion) can make it more likely that someone will develop an anxiety disorder.7﻿ Researchers sometimes use the terms ""trait anxiety"" and ""state anxiety"" when they are discussing the influence of personality on mental health. For example, a person who has trait anxiety might feel anxious more often and more intensely than people who do not. State anxiety, on the other hand, is when a person feels anxious about a specific situation that they are in—it is a temporary ""state"" of anxiety as opposed to the persistent trait of being anxious.9﻿ Everyone, regardless of their underlyingpersonality type, experiences anxiety at one time or another. However, a person's personality might influence how anxiety feels to them as well as how they deal with it. While there are many variations ofpersonalityand no two people are exactly alike in how they experience and respond to the world, there are four personality categories that are often discussed. These types exist on a spectrum that most people can find themselves on somewhere—even if they're somewhat ""in the middle"" rather than at one end or the other. These are just a few broad examples of how certainpersonality traitsor dispositions might influence the way you experience anxiety as well as how you cope with it. There are many more personality variations than type A or type B and introversion or extroversion, but these are four categories that are most people are familiar with and can provide an illustration of how personality can influence the experience of anxiety. People with a""type A"" personalityare generally described as being high-achievers, competitive, organized, ambitious, and (at times) impatient and aggressive. Some psychological researchers use the term ""neurotic"" or ""neuroticism"" to describe the behaviors and tendencies of people with type A personalities.10﻿ People who are type A personalities are often described as ""workaholics."" In some cases, being under pressure or stress is motivating for people with this personality type—though, at the same time, research has shown that this personality type is more likely to have job-related stress than other types, and might not be that satisfied with their work (even if they are succeeding or achieving).11﻿ When under stress, type A personalities might be more likely than other personality types to engage in self-defeating behaviors, such asprocrastinationor poor lifestyle habits. In a sense, when type A personalities become overwhelmed, they can ""get in their own way"" if their anxiety goes unchecked. Research has found that type A personalities are more likely to develop stress-related illnesses than other types.12﻿ This risk is believed to a direct consequence of their dominant emotions, behaviors, and coping mechanisms, which tend to raise the level of stress hormones in their bodies. At the opposite end of the spectrum from high-alert, high-stress, and hypervigilant type As are the laid-back, low-stress, and less competitive""type B"" personalities. In almost every way type A's opposite, type B personalities tend to carry on with their work and often succeed without being as strongly focused on achievement or ""winning.""10﻿ Type Bs report less stress in all areas of their lives—not just at work—and tend to be more tolerant and patient with the people around them than type As. However, it's not always rosy for type Bs. Some research has found that they are more likely to havesubstance use disordersthan type As. Studies have also demonstrated that a core difference between type As and type Bs is how they define success—which, for many people, can be tied to anxious feelings. Likely because they are inherently more competitive, type A personalities tend to have higher criteria for defining what it means to succeed than type Bs.11﻿ As they work toward achievement, type As have been found to use strategies that let them internalize success while externalizing failure (in other words, placing the blame for the failure on an outside factor rather than seeing it as a reflection of themselves) more so than type Bs.13﻿ When under stress, type B personalities have also found to be more likely to take preventative steps or precautions compared to type A personalities.14﻿ The primary difference between introverts and extroverts comes down to a person's preference for becoming energized. A person who is introverted needs time alone to ""recharge"" away from social activity, but this does not necessarily mean that they dislike being around others. Conversely, extroverts get their energy from being around others—though that does not mean that they never want to have time alone. People who are introvertedtend to need time alone to process their experience of themselves and the world around them. When they are under a great deal of stress, being forced to be in a social setting can be extremely challenging and exhausting. Introverts need to have time away from others to reflect, recharge, and potentially even reframe their feelings, perceptions, experiences, and thoughts. If they do not get this time (or don't get enough of it), they are less likely to function optimally. When overwhelmed by a stressor or source of conflict, introverts are more likely to useavoidance coping mechanismsthan extroverts.15﻿ While retreating from a stressful event might provide some short-term relief, it does not tend to be an effective way to cope. However, research has also indicated that introverted personalities often report that they oftenreach out to mental health professionalsor engage in healthy behaviors to relieve their stress, such as exercise.15﻿ People who are extrovertedfind that being around others gives them energy. They find that engaging in social activity is essential to their experience of themselves, the world, and their relationships with the people around them. If extroverts are isolated from others, it can be difficult for them to get what they need to process experiences and feelings. If they are under a great deal of stress, having too much time alone or not being able to reach out and be with others can make it much more difficult for them to function. Research has found that extroverts tend to have an easier time relaxing than introverts. Several studies have hypothesized that the neural structure of an extrovert's brain is ""wired"" to relax more quickly from a state of arousal than an introvert's brain—which can be extremely helpful in times of stress.16﻿ Extroverts are also more likely to confront problems than introverts, and while this can certainly lead to conflict, addressing the source of stress can also be a healthy coping mechanism.15﻿ While personality can influence how stress feels to you as well as what methods of coping are effective, there are also other variables. Research has also found that sex, gender, age, intellect, experiences, and other elements of who are as an individual shape your stress response.17﻿ For example, how likely you are to take risks, how comfortable you are with uncertainty, how open you are with new experiences (and how often you seek them out), and howconscientiousyou are toward others can also influence your response to anxiety. Sometimes, other emotions are disguised as anxiety, or anxiety is experienced in place of another emotion. Three of the most common feelings that can be disguised by anxiety areanger,guilt, andgrief. For example, for many people, anxiety is part of theirfear response.18﻿ If someone is having feelings that are uncomfortable or difficult to express, these emotions might also be transformed into anxiety. Many people struggle to absorb, process, express, and understand these feelings and honor their intent (to express dislike, ask for forgiveness, accept a loss, etc.). Instead, a person might become focused on (and anxious about) specific aspects of a situation (such as every detail of how an upcoming event might go). In reality, being preoccupied and worried about the fine details of something that is causing someone anxiety is not as important as addressing their underlying feelings—however messy, difficult, and uncomfortable they might be. If you are experiencing the confusion of your emotions and anxiety (which include a subset of people with GAD), the first step is looking within yourself to find out what feelings are being disguised by anxiety. Then, you also need to figure out if certain aspects of your personality (including learned behaviors and poor coping mechanisms) are contributing to the confusion and whether or not these are things you can (and are ready to) work on.19 Both of these goals are often part of thetreatment for GAD. If they resonate with you, it's worth asking your healthcare provider or mental health professional about how you can address your anxiety. There are different modalities of treatment for anxiety disorders, and some of them might appeal to you more than others. Developing an understanding of how certain aspects of your personality might be affecting your anxiety can help you choose a method to try. Discuss your unique traits, tendencies, and preferences with your provider as you consider different options for treating your anxiety. If you or a loved one are struggling with generalized anxiety disorder, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-cope-with-generalized-anxiety-disorder-1393164,dynamic,Mental Health,Coping with GAD,"Rachel Goldman, PhD FTOS, is a licensed psychologist, clinical assistant professor, speaker, wellness expert specializing in eating behaviors, stress management, and health behavior change. If you have generalizedanxietydisorder (GAD), it is essential to learn how to cope with persistent anxiety and physical symptoms. While everyone's experience with GAD is different, there are manycommon symptomsthat almost everyone will experience to some degree. These symptoms include physical symptoms (muscle tension, body aches, etc.), behavioral symptoms (procrastination, isolation, etc.), and emotional symptoms (intrusive thoughts, constant worry, etc.). Fortunately, there are various coping styles and strategies that can help you manage all of them.1 Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by physical, behavioral, and emotional symptoms that create distress and interfere with your ability to function. To cope, you can: Keep reading to learn more about tactics to help you cope with feelings of anxiety and worry and why it is so important to seek treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. Social support is an essential part of dealing with a mental health condition like generalized anxiety disorder. For some people, social coping strategies can help manage symptoms, overcome fear, and even improve social life for an overall better quality of life. Effective options include the following. When we feel anxious it is common to want to pull away from others and disconnect. This leads us to feeling removed from others, our family, and our community. Finding events to participate in can help foster a sense of belonging and allow us to feel purposeful. Not only are we keeping our bodies busy, but our minds as well. Instead of ruminating on worries, social activities give us something else to focus on. By taking our minds off of our worries, it can provide relief from some GAD symptoms. Anxiety can lead us to believe that we are alone in our experience and no one will be able to relate. This is not true. Find a trusted person to talk with about your challenges. Share with important people in your life the experiences you are struggling with and don't be afraid to open up conversation. Being open about your challenges can also allow other people the space to share their struggles. Finding a support system is important when we are struggling with anxiety.2There are a variety of support resources available, in-person and online, that can be of great help. A community of people who understand and can offer tips and suggestions for helpful coping strategies can be valuable. Anxiety tends to rob us of joy and gets in the way of us being able to have fun. Remember to nurture your longing to have fun and laugh. Research has found that humor can be an everyday tool to protect against anxiety and promote mental health.3 You can find humor in books, on television, or in online sources. Taking a moment to laugh and have fun can offer a gentle reminder that the anxiety is not in charge. Emotional symptoms like worry,rumination, and intrusive thinking are also common for people with generalized anxiety disorder. Try these strategies for coping with intrusive thoughts, constant worry or fear, feelings of uncertainty, apprehension, dread, or overwhelm. There are varied practices ofmindfulnessthat can help with anxiety. Using techniques like mindfulness, prayer, and deep breathing can help slow down our anxious processing of thoughts and emotions.4 Need a breather? Take this free5-minute meditation focused on relieving anxiety—or choose from ourguided meditation libraryto find another one that will help you feel your best. By slowing down we are learning to be more present rather than hyper-focused on trying to anticipate and prepare for the future, which is what anxiety makes us focus on, even when there are no threats present. As you practice slowing down and becoming more mindful, it will be helpful for you to pay attention to the situations that seem to trigger your anxiety. Although it won't always be an option to avoid those triggers, being aware of them can help you gain clarity and take steps toward managing stress in those specific situations. Learning cognitive ways to challenge your anxiety can help, such as diffusing anxious thoughts and calming the need to keep asking ""what if."" Remember that anxiety is not something you are experiencing because you are flawed in any way. Anxiety is influenced by ahost of factorssuch as genetics, neurobiology, family history, and life experiences. There isno one cause of GADand it is something that many people experience.5 As impossible as it may seem, it can be helpful to learn to accept the journey and embrace it as an opportunity to learn and care for yourself in healthy ways. Accepting your emotions canimprove your overall emotional health.6Identifying the emotions is thefirst of multiple stepsto achieving this. There is no need to lose hope for better living. Many people challenged with anxiety, such as with generalized anxiety disorder, leadfull, productive, and joyful lives. The key is taking time to learn what strategies work well for you, stay connected to others, and remain positive. Find inspiration through quotes, verses, music, nature, social connections, etc. We are surrounded by positive examples of hope and inspiration. Physical coping strategies, like eating well, exercising, breathing, and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine, can help with emotional symptoms as well. What we put into our bodies can influence how we feel physically and emotionally. Although foods do not cause anxiety, they can impact our mood. Some evidence does suggest that people who consume diets high in fat, sugar, and refined carbohydrates experience higher levels of anxiety, while those who consume diets higher in fruits, vegetables, and micronutrients have lower levels of anxiety.7 Eating things like sugary snacks and processed foods can lead to quick highs and lows in our blood sugar that can influence feelings of restlessness and fatigue. Research has shown that exercise can be an effective treatment for anxiety.8Moving your body can be a great way to managestress. Exercise helps to boost our endorphins and relieve tension. The key is to find something you can do regularly. Try something new or go with an old favorite activity you enjoy. Any way that you choose to exercise will be of benefit. Keep a consistent schedule and try to incorporate exercise three to four times per week or more. You may also try massage orprogressive muscle relaxationto help ease muscle tension often experienced with anxiety. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), only one in three adults in the United States get the recommended seven hours of sleep at night.9 Although it can be difficult to sleep when we experience anxiety, creating a reliable nighttime routine can help us relax and prepare for quality sleep. Things likeprogressive muscle relaxation, reading, journaling, and turning off electronics at least one hour before bed can help you prepare your mind and body for rest. Doing a ""brain dump,"" or writing a to-do list or worry log as part of your bedtime routine can also help if you struggle withracing thoughtsand anxiety. Dysfunctional, shallow breathing is one of the common symptoms of anxiety. This quick, shallow breathing is often accompanied by chest tightness and muscle tension. In those moments, we often forget to breathe and take rapid, shallow breaths. Practicing how to takeslow abdominal breathscan help. Research has shown that breathwork interventions are an effective way to reduce feelings of anxiety.10 It can also be helpful to implement some of the strategies that are often used incognitive-behavioral interventionsfor generalized anxiety disorder. Some tactics that can be helpful include: Cognitive reframinginvolves changing how you view a situation to see it more realistically or positively. Shifting how you view situations can help reduce feelings of anxiety.11For example, if you reframe a stressful situation at work as a potential learning opportunity, you might find it less stressful and overwhelming. Generalized anxiety disorder is marked by constant worrying. A more effective way to cope is to engage inproblem-solvingto find solutions. That way, instead of worrying, you can take effective steps to address the problem.12 Skills that can help stave off worry and rumination include: Exposure therapyis a treatment for anxiety that involves being progressively and systematically exposed to things that make you anxious. With repeated exposure, feelings of fear and worry gradually begin to fade. Things to keep in mind as you walk through your journey with generalized anxiety disorder is that you are not alone and you can live a full life. Although anxiety and worry may be an obstacle for you now, and even feel uncontrollable at times, there are resources, trained professionals, and coping techniques available to help. Learning how to navigate your triggers, reaching out for help, and keeping a positive attitude all help. Taking care of yourself also involves talking with a professional who can put aplan of treatmentin place. Talking with a counselor or other mental health provider on a regular basis can be helpful as well, to know that someone understands your experience and can help you learn to effectively navigate challenges as they arise.

Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Hero Images / Getty Images Differentiating betweennormal everyday anxietyandgeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD)can be tricky. How do you know, especially if you are a little more anxious than others, whether or not your anxiety is significant enough to qualify as a disorder? Many peoplefeel anxiousfrom time to time, especially during times of stress. However, when you worry excessively, so much so that it interferes with day-to-day activities, you might have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).1 Some peopledevelop GAD as a childwhile others do not see symptomsuntil they are an adult. Either way, living with GAD can last a long time. In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders. GAD is around twice as common in women as in men. Because anxiety affects women at a greater rate, experts recommend routine anxiety screening for women and girls aged 13 and older.2 Anxiety can grow worse over time and have a serious impact on a person's ability to function normally, which is why treatment is so important. In most cases, it improves with medications and/or ​talk therapy.1﻿ Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills, and using relaxation techniques also can help. GAD symptoms can include:1﻿ Physical signs and symptoms may include:1﻿ The following is a brief guide to determining whether generalized anxiety disorder may be something that you are struggling with.3﻿ Although at times the anxiety that all people experience can be somewhat severe, a characteristic of GAD is that this anxiety is usually more intense and long-lasting. If you have more severe anxiety than most other people you know, then it may be more than ""normal"" anxiety. The experience of anxiety for most people is proportionate to the intensity of the situation. For example, if there was a minor anxiety-provoking situation, then the experience of anxiety is typically minor as well. People with GAD, on the other hand, tend to become more anxious than the situation appears to warrant. If you are someone who has more severe anxiety over “things that shouldn’t be a big deal,” it may be more than normal anxiety. When people experience normal anxiety, they tend to worry about things related to the anxiety-provoking situation or several other things that make them fearful. People with GAD tend to be described as ""worrying about everything all the time.” If that describes you, it may be more than normal anxiety. Most people can reduce and control their anxiety through a variety of coping techniques and have the ability to calm themselves. However, people with GAD have significant difficulty finding relaxation, calm, and time away from theirworries. If you have more difficulty than other people you know in controlling your anxiety, it may be more than normal anxiety. If you or a loved one are struggling with excessive anxiety, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-anxiety-5225364,dynamic,Mental Health,Types of Anxiety,"Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the ""Everything Psychology Book."" Maskot / Getty Images Anxiety is a common problem for many American adults. In fact, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders are the most common types of mental health conditions in the United States, affecting almost 20% of all adults.1Anxiety is also common among children and adolescents.2 However, not all anxiety is the same. The butterflies you feel in your stomach before giving a presentation at work feel very different than the sense of dread and foreboding you might feel when watching the nightly news. The source of your anxiety influences how you might experience it. It also impacts how you might go about addressing it. Anxiety can have different causes, which means that each type of anxiety may require different solutions. Understanding the different types of anxiety and which one you are experiencing can offer you insight into why you feel the way you do. Anticipatory anxietyrefers to the feelings of fear that you experience before an event. While it is normal to feel stress about future events, anticipatory anxiety involves an excessive worry about the future. A certain degree of stress can be adaptive and help you perform your best. When this anxiety becomes severe, it can be debilitating. This type of anxiety might cause you to become overly focused on adverse outcomes. It can also be all-consuming and long-lasting. Instead of feeling a little nervous right before an event, you might find yourself overwhelmed with feelings of worry and fear for weeks or months beforehand. You might experience this type of anxiety in response to a wide variety of events, including: While it might involve anxiety about upcoming events, it can also occur in response to everyday occurrences. For example, you might experience anxiety about driving to work or catching the train. Anticipatory anxiety is not a distinct mental health condition. Instead, it is often a symptom of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. One way to deal with anticipatory anxiety is to try relabeling your emotions. Instead of calling your feelings nervousness or anxiety, work on reframing them as excitement and anticipation. For example, instead of saying “I’m nervous,” you would say, “I’m so excited.” This technique, known as anxiety reappraisal, is an effective strategy that helps people change their interpretations of physical arousal symptoms.3 Generalized anxiety is a chronic and exaggerated worry that occurs without having a specific source. This type of anxiety is also sometimes referred to asfree-floating anxiety. People who experience this type of anxiety spend a lot of time worrying about a wide variety of future events. Such anxiety may center on health, social interactions, work, relationships, and everyday events. If a person experiences excessive worry that interferes with essential areas of life and lasts most days for longer than six months, they may be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Some symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder include:4 Generalized anxiety tends to be twice as common in women as in men. Women tend to experience anxiety disorders at higher rates, so experts suggest that women and girls over the age of 13 should be screened during routine health exams.5 If you experience generalized anxiety, you should talk to a primary healthcare provider or a mental health professional. They can determine if your symptoms meet the generalized anxiety disorder diagnostic criteria. They can also recommend effective treatments, including psychotherapy and medications. Finding strategies to helpcope with generalized anxietycan also be helpful. Finding social support, practicingmindfulness, and learningemotional acceptancemay be helpful. Panic is a type of anxiety that involves sudden and intense feelings of fear. When a person experiences a panic attack, they may experience racing heartbeat, chest pain, trembling, sweating, a sense ofimpending doom, feeling out of control, or feeling as if they are dying. Panic attacksare a symptom of an anxiety disorder known as panic disorder. People with this condition worry that they will have a panic attack in the future, so they often avoid places or situations where they think they might experience feelings of panic. Treatments for panic disorder include medications and psychotherapy. Healthcare providers may prescribe antidepressants orbenzodiazepinesto treat symptoms of panic. Antidepressants tend to take longer to work and can lessen feelings of anxiety over time. Benzodiazepines, on the other hand, are fast-acting and can help reduce symptoms of acute anxiety. Learning relaxation techniques can also be helpful when you feel yourself beginning to experience symptoms of panic.Deep breathingcan be particularly helpful since people often engage in rapid, shallow breathing when they are panicked.6 Performance anxiety involves anxiety related to a person's ability to perform a specific task. Sometimes known as stage fright, this type of anxiety emerges when a person is expected to perform a task, such as giving a speech or competing in an athletic event. Common symptoms of performance anxiety include trembling, stomach upset, nausea, shortness of breath, and an increased number of mistakes while performing. Escape behaviors, such as finding an excuse to avoid the task or performance, may also occur. Types of performance anxiety can include: Sometimes this type of anxiety involves mild nervousness. To a certain point, feeling a little stress can help improve performance. When you are stressed, your body goes into a state of alert, known as thefight or flight response. This response prepares you both physically and mentally to handle the situation. However, when this anxiety becomes excessive, it can negatively affect performance. You might forget important details, get distracted, or be completely unable to perform. In some cases, stage fright can lead to panic attacks. Sometimes anxiety can result from aphobia, which is an intense and exaggerated fear of a specific object or situation. Common examples of specific phobias include feeling extreme fear in response to blood, flying, heights, needles, spiders, or snakes. When people have a phobia, they may experience a great deal of anxiety and worry about potentially encountering the source of their fear. They will also take steps to avoid what they are afraid of, often in ways that limit their ability to function normally. For example, a person might stop leaving their house altogether because they are so worried about coming into contact with the thing they fear. Exposure therapycan be very effective for this type of anxiety. In exposure treatments, a person is gradually exposed to the source of their fear in a safe, controlled manner.7 This exposure may also be paired with a variety of relaxation techniques so that people can replace anxiety with calmer responses. Separation anxietyinvolves excessive anxiety in response to being separated from a caregiver, loved one, or another attachment figure. It is often associated with early childhood, but it can also occur at other points throughout life. This type of anxiety is a normal and healthy part of child development that typically occurs between eight and 14 months. It is regarded as a normal part of development up until age two. Signs of this type of anxiety include excessive crying, clinginess, and refusal to interact with others after a parent or caregiver leaves. When this anxiety occurs after age two, it may be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder. It can also affect adults. Signs of the condition include excessive distress, worry, and reluctance when separated from an attachment figure. Separation anxiety can sometimes occur during times of stress or transition. Starting school, going to college, moving to a new town, or starting a new job might trigger feelings of this type of anxiety. Situational anxietyis a type of anxiety that is triggered by certain situations. Many people experience this type of anxiety from time to time. For example, you might feel situational anxiety on the first day at a new job or before an important presentation at work. When facing something that causes feelings of situational anxiety, you might experience a range of symptoms. For example, you might have trouble sleeping or have an upset stomach. Muscle tension, diarrhea, nausea, sweating, and restlessness are also common. People can often deal with this type of anxiety using relaxation techniques like deep breathing or visualization. Being well-prepared for the situation can also be helpful. For example, if you know that you will be anxious during an upcoming job interview, practicing the interview and being prepared to answer questions can make you feel less anxious. If the thought of having to make small talk with a room full of strangers makes you feel tense and anxious, then you might be experiencing social anxiety. Social anxiety is commonly defined as a fear of social situations. However, it can manifest in several different ways. For some people, social anxiety is primarily triggered by unfamiliar social situations. This might involve meeting new people in situations such as job interviews or work-related events. Sometimes this anxiety only occurs during high-pressure moments, such as giving a speech in front of a large group of people. In other cases, however, people find themselves experiencing feelings of fear and anxiety in almost every social encounter. Everyday activities like answering the phone or eating in a public place can become daunting or scary. Social anxiety can cause a range ofphysical and cognitive symptoms. For example, during an anxiety-inducing social situation, you might experience physical symptoms such as blushing, shortness of breath, dry mouth, and a trembling voice. Negative thoughts and beliefsare also common. You might tell yourself that everyone is judging you or that you aren't interesting enough. As a result of this fear, people often begin avoiding situations that lead to feelings of anxiety. The problem is that this strategy leads to isolation and loneliness. It also tends to make social anxiety worse. If a person's social anxiety is persistent and disrupts their daily functioning, they may be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. So what does work for combatting this type of anxiety? While each person’s needs are different, practicing social skills is often very effective. By becoming more skilled at talking to other people, people become more confident in social situations. Anxiety is a common problem for many people, but not all anxiety is the same. It's important to recognize the type of anxiety you are experiencing so that you can understand what is causing it. If anxiety is causing disruptions in your life and making it hard to function, talk to a primary healthcare provider or a mental health professional. Because anxiety often worsens over time, acting early can help you find relief and minimize the detrimental effects on your life. National Institute of Mental Health.Any anxiety disorder.

https://www.verywellmind.com/anxiety-disorder-2510539,dynamic,Mental Health,Overview of Anxiety Disorders,"Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Stefanie Grewel / Getty Images Anxiety disorders are serious mental illnesses that cause significant worry or fear that doesn't go away and may even get worse over time. We all feel anxious at times, but with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety tends to be fairly constant and has a very negative and intrusive impact on quality of life. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 19.1% of adults in the United States have some type of anxiety disorder.1Women are also more likely to be affected by anxiety, which is why experts now recommend that women and girls over the age of 13 should be screened for anxiety disorders as part of routine medical care.2 There are severaltypes of anxietydisorders. While all are characterized by symptoms of anxiety, each has its own unique set of characteristics, symptoms, and criteria for diagnosis. Agoraphobiais an irrational and extreme fear of being in a situation where escape is impossible. People often fear that they will experience symptoms of panic or other symptoms in public, which leads them to avoid any situation where they may feel panicked, helpless, or trapped. These avoidance behaviors are often life-limiting, often causing people to avoid driving, shopping in public, air travel, or other situations. In some cases, this fear can become so severe that people are unable to leave their homes. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)involves excessive worry and anxiety related to various activities and events. This worry is difficult to control and often shifts from one concern to another. While there is no specific threat, people with GAD find themselves feeling anxious about everyday daily events, current events in the news, relationships, or potential events that might occur. Panic disorderinvolves experiencing intense and persistent panic attacks that occur unexpectedly with little or no warning. Apanic attackhas physical and emotional symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, increased respiration, and feelings of extreme terror. Selective mutismis an anxiety disorder that occurs during childhood. It involves experiencing anxiety, embarrassment, or fear that prevents children from speaking in specific settings, such as while at school or around strangers. Selective mutism usually occurs between the ages of two and four and is often accompanied by fidgeting, lack of eye contact, and lack of expressions when faced with a situation the child fears. Social anxiety disorder (SAD), previously known as social phobia, involves a fear of social situations. This fear may center on specific events, such as public speaking, or may involve a more generalized fear of many different social situations. People who have this condition have an exaggerated sense that other people scrutinize everything they do. They may be very critical of themselves and experience both physical and emotional symptoms of fear in social situations. Such symptoms include shaking, racing heartbeat, stomach upset, and dread. These symptoms often lead people to avoid social situations whenever possible. Specific phobiasinvolve intense fear of a specific object or situation that is overwhelming, irrational, and out of proportion to the actual threat. When they encounter the source of their fear, people with a specific phobia experience immediate symptoms such as sweating, crying, shaking, rapid heartbeat, and increased respiration. As often happens with other anxiety disorders, people with a phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the source of their fear. Suchavoidance behaviorscan cause additional stress and limit daily activities. The fifth edition of the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" (DSM-5), which healthcare providers use to diagnose mental health conditions,breaks what have generally been considered anxiety disorders into three categories: This differentiation shows that while the disorders have a commonality and are related, they are distinctly different. These classifications have remained in place in the most recent edition of the diagnostic manual, the DSM-5-TR. While OCD and PTSD are no longer officially categorized as anxiety disorders, they share many characteristics, and anxiety symptoms are common in both conditions. Obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) involves experiencing intrusive thoughts, known as obsessions, and behaviors, known as compulsions. Before the publication of the DSM-5, OCD was considered a type of anxiety disorder, because these obsessions create significant anxiety for many people. Obsessions may focus on things such as a fear of germs, a need to have things in a certain order, or disturbing thoughts about taboo topics. Compulsions are behaviors that people often engage in as a way to relieve the anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts. They might involve actions such as counting, ordering, checking, or washing. Conditions related to OCD and also listed in the category ""OCD and related disorders"" includebody-dysmorphic disorder,hoarding disorder, andtrichotillomania. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)is a condition that can occur following a traumatic event. It includes symptoms such as changes in mood, arousal, and reactivity. People may have intrusive thoughts, memories, and nightmares related to the trauma. Flashbacks, hypervigilance, anxiety, and avoidance of reminders are other common symptoms. Other trauma- and stressor-related disorders in this DSM group includeadjustment disorders, andreactive attachment disorder Types of anxiety disorders include agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Other conditions, including OCD and PTSD, also feature symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety disorders come with a host of symptoms and no one person has the same experience. Each disorder tends to have different symptoms as well. The symptoms common to anxiety disorders in general include: When you experience the physical and psychological signs offear and anxietysuch as sweating, racing heart, shortness of breath, trembling, worry, or stress, these are cues that something is happening that could be a threat and that you need to deal with it. This“flight or fight” reactionactivates the physical and psychological resources necessary to deal with the potential danger. Although this system works well most of the time, sometimes it can go into overdrive and do more harm than good. When this happens, it might indicate you have an anxiety disorder. Most people experience some anxiety from time to time. The difference between normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder involves the amount of distress it causes and how it affects your ability to function normally.3 Millions of American adults (as well as children and teens) will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. No one knows exactlywhat causes anxietydisorders, although genetics, environment, stress level, brain changes, and trauma may all play a role. Researchers are discovering more about these links all the time. A combination of factors likely plays a role in causing anxiety conditions. Some factors that have been implicated include: There are no lab tests that can be done to diagnose an anxiety disorder, though a doctor may perform some tests to rule out physical problems.6Your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a counselor, who will use specific diagnostic tools and questions to help determine what sort of disorder you may have. A doctor or mental health professional will ask questions and use assessment tools to help determine if you have a disorder. They will want to know the nature of your symptoms, how long they last, and how severe they are. They will also want to understand how they interfere with your ability to function in your everyday daily life. Healthcare practitioners use the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" (DSM) to diagnose these conditions. Each disorder in the DSM lists specific symptom criteria that a person must meet to be diagnosed with a particular condition.

Psychotherapycan help people learn to manage the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of anxiety. One particularly effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders iscognitive behavioral therapy(CBT). This approach focuses on helping people identify the automatic negative thoughts andcognitive distortionsthat contribute to feelings of anxiety. Exposure therapyis another type of CBT that can be helpful for some types of anxiety. In this approach, people are gradually exposed to the things that they fear, often while simultaneously using relaxation techniques to help calm the body's stress response. Research has found that CBT can be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. It can also be helpful for anxiety that occurs as part of OCD and PTSD.7 Somemedicationscan also be prescribed to help relieve symptoms of anxiety. Some of the medications that are most often used for anxiety include: Coping strategiesoften focus on ways to manage anxiety more effectively. Lifestyle changes such as limiting caffeine intake, getting enough rest, and engaging in regular exercise may be helpful. One study found that exercise significantly reduces symptoms of anxiety, suggesting that it may be useful for preventing and even treating symptoms of anxiety.8 Stress management techniques includingdeep breathing, yoga, andprogressive muscle relaxationcan also be beneficial when managing feelings of anxiety.Apps for anxietycan help guide you through these techniques. If you have an anxiety disorder, there are plenty of treatment options available to help you live your life to the fullest. Remember, treatment can take time before you and your physician discover the best options for you. Be patient and keep communication open with your mental health professional in order to figure out the plan best tailored to your individual needs.

https://www.verywellmind.com/fear-and-anxiety-differences-and-similarities-2584399,dynamic,Mental Health,Fear vs Anxiety,"Amy Morin, LCSW, is a psychotherapist and international bestselling author. Her books, including ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,"" have been translated into more than 40 languages. Her TEDx talk,  ""The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong,"" is one of the most viewed talks of all time. People Images / Getty Images While we often use anxiety and fear interchangeably, they are not the same thing. The two experiences are related and often share many of the same emotional and physical symptoms, but there are important differences that make them distinct—and understanding what makes them different can play an important part in how you deal with them. Even though symptoms commonly overlap, a person's experience with these emotions differs based on context. Fear relates to a known or understood threat, whereas anxiety follows from an unknown, expected, or poorly defined threat.1 Anxiety and fear share much in common (and they often occur together). Fear tends to be shorter-lived and happens in response to a clear cause—like an environmental threat. Anxiety is often longer-lasting and can be more ambiguous. Knowing how to recognize the differences can help you get the right treatment. Fear and anxiety both produce a similar stress response. However, many experts believe that there are essential differences between the two. These differences can account for how we react to various environmental stressors.2 Muscle tension, increased heart rate, and shortness of breath mark the most significant physiological symptoms associated with a response to danger. These bodily changes result from our inbornfight-or-flight stress responsecritical to survival. Without this stress response, our mind wouldn't receive the alerting danger signal and our bodies would be unable to prepare to flee or stay and battle when faced with danger. Anxiety is a diffuse, unpleasant, vague sense of apprehension.3It's often a response to an imprecise or unknown threat such as the uneasiness you might feel walking down a dark street alone. Your uneasiness in this situation would be caused by anxiety related to thepossibilityof something bad happening, such as being harmed by a stranger, rather than an immediate threat. This anxiety stems from your mind’s interpretation of the possible dangers. Fear is an emotional response to a known or definite threat. If you're walking down a dark street, for example, and someone points a gun at you and says, “This is a robbery,"" then you'd likely experience a fear response. The danger is real, definite, and immediate. There's a clear and present object of the fear.1 Although the focus of the response is different (real vs. imagined danger), fear and anxiety are interrelated. When faced with fear, most people will experience the physical reactions that are described under anxiety. Fear can cause anxiety, and anxiety can cause fear. However, the subtle distinctions between the two give you a better understanding of your symptoms. It can also help you and your doctor decide which treatment strategies will be the most effective. The exact distinctions between anxiety and fear can also be challenging for researchers. Some have suggested that more research is needed to understand if the two are as different as previously suggested. Neuroimaging studies, for example, may be able to shed greater light on how fear and anxiety are connected.4 Anxiety and fear can lead to many uncomfortable somatic (physical) sensations. Some of the most commonphysical symptoms of anxietyinclude:1 The physical and emotional sensations associated with fear include: The physical sensations of fear and anxiety are very similar. Because they both evoke the same type of physical and emotional response, it can make it more difficult to tell the difference between them. Fear often stems from the threat of potential harm, whether that threat is physical, psychological, or emotional. While we often think of fear as a negative, distressing state, it can also have benefits. Healthy levels of fear or anxiety can prepare the body to respond to potential dangers, mobilizing you to respond quickly when needed. When you encounter a threat, it triggers a response in your amygdala, a brain structure that plays a key role in the body's fight, flight, freeze, or fawn response. This leads to a cascade of reactions that prepare your muscles to respond and trigger the release of stress hormones. Unhealthy anxiety levels can cause distress and interfere with your ability to function in your daily life. Fear and anxiety are associated with many mental health conditions. These feelings are most often linked to anxiety disorders, such as: Other conditions such aspost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)andobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)can also cause feelings of anxiety. Approximately 20% of U.S. adults experience symptoms of an anxiety disorder during any given year, and women tend to experience these symptoms more often than men. Because of this, experts now recommend that all women over the age of 13 should be screened for anxiety conditions.5 If you are having symptoms of fear and anxiety that have become unmanageable, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor will consider your current symptoms and your medical history to help determine a possible cause of your fear and anxiety. From there, expect your doctor to make a diagnosis or refer you to a specialty treatment provider for further assessment. Once diagnosed, you can start on atreatment planthat can assist in reducing and controlling your fear and anxiety. Treatments for anxiety and fear often involve: In addition to getting help from your doctor or therapist, there are also strategies you can use on your own to help manage your feelings of anxiety and fear. Facing your fear (in a safe way) is often one of the best ways to overcome it. The more often you engage in activities you fear, the less frightening they become. Over time, you'll become more comfortable and able to face the challenge without experiencing fear.

https://www.verywellmind.com/magical-thinking-in-generalized-anxiety-disorder-4151291,dynamic,Mental Health,Magical Thinking in GAD,"Laura Harold is a former editor and contributing writer for Verywell Mind. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Magical thinking is the belief that your thoughts, feelings, or actions will affect someone's behavior or the outcome of a situation.1Many of us engage in magical thinking from time to time. Superstitions fall into the category of magical thinking, such asavoiding the 13th floor of a buildingor needing your lucky pencil to take a test. Rituals like tossing a coin into a fountain, crossing your fingers, or making a wish before blowing out your birthday candles are types of magical thinking. Many of us perform these actions without any disruption to our day-to-day lives. While magical thinking can be fun and harmless, it can become disruptive. Mental health conditions likegeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD)andobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)are often associated with disruptive types of magical thinking. This article covers the definition and examples of magical thinking, what psychology says about this phenomenon, and when magical thinking may become disruptive—especially for those with mental health disorders. Magical thinking often occurs in young children under the age of 5.2Young children don't yet understand that their mind is separate from the world around them. For instance, a young child believes that their wishing for something causes it to happen. Magical thinking is common in adolescents and adults as well—some research indicates it is normative and occurs alongside rational thinking.2 People often use magical thinking to feel more in control of their environment and to cope with the unknown. Magical thinking can also occur in a variety of mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders,psychosis,schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, andeating disorders.2 Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry that is difficult to control. To receive aGAD diagnosis, the excessive worry must also be accompanied by certain physical or cognitive symptoms like irritability, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, restlessness, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances.3 For a person with GAD, magical thinking can become a coping mechanism they use to try to lessen their anxiety.2 Someone with GAD might think about every potential negative outcome of a situation, and by doing so, they may believe that they are preventing the negative outcomes from happening. For example, if they are nervous about an upcoming job interview, they might picture themselves getting lost on the way, losing their phone, and making a terrible first impression on the interviewer. By thinking about what theydon'twant to happen, they believe they're protecting themselves against these undesirable outcomes. With GAD, a person tends to believe that their anxiety and their anxious thoughts control the world around them. There are two types of magical thinking that are important in anxiety disorders: thought-action fusion and routines (also calledrituals). This type of magical thinking involves believing that thoughts are the equivalent of actions and that thoughts can make actions come true. An example of thought-action fusion is when you hear someone say, ""Don't speak negative things about someone or that person will get sick,"" which implies that a person's thoughts alone influence the health of another person. Some who experience thought-action fusion oftenfeel shame, believing that having a negative thought does as much damage as if the thought were to happen in real life. If a thought pops into your head about hurting your partner, you might feelguiltybecause you believe youarehurting them by having the thought—even when you'd never act upon it. Routines or rituals involve performing certain actions physically or mentally to ""magically"" make something happen (or stop something from happening). A common example of this is someone knocking on wood every time they think of something theydon'twant to happen. Magical thinking can be adaptive (helpful) or maladaptive (unhelpful), depending on how your thoughts affect you, your relationships, andyour quality of life. Magical thinking can promote feelings ofconfidenceandoptimismin people. Many people who engage in magical thinking don't see it as ""magic"" at all, but rather as their personal beliefs and theories. It's important to contextualize magical thinking in terms of a person's cultural, religious, and spiritual beliefs, too. What one person calls magical thinking, another person calls a belief system. Sometimes, magical thinking helps us interpret the world around us in an adaptive way. If it causes significant distress or disruption in your life, however, it's advisable to reexamine your magical thinking. One study suggests that clinicians examine the following criteria when determining if a person's magical thoughts are adaptive or maladaptive:2 You mightput pressure on yourselfto ""make things happen"" with your thoughts or behaviors to the point that you feel personally responsible for negative events. Or, you might feel like you ""messed up"" when you forget to perform a ritual related to a desired outcome. Maybe you punish yourself or have a lot ofnegative self-talkwhen you don't think the ""right"" kinds of thoughts. A mental healthcare professional may help you address magical thinking if you find it disruptive to your life. People with GAD who have maladaptive beliefs rooted in magical thinking may not want to let go of these beliefs. David Burns, MD, writes that although theanxiety people with GAD experienceas a result of magical thinking is uncomfortable or distressing, people with GAD often still believe that this anxiety is protecting them from some greater catastrophe. A person with GAD may be convinced that intense worrying is the key to their success or that if they don't over-plan, over-research, or generally over-worry about everything, things will fall apart. If a person feels that letting go of their anxiety may result in bad outcomes, it's not surprising that they would be resistant to treatment for their anxiety (and by extension, their magical thinking). If you find that your magical thinking is disruptive or distressing, there are steps you can take both on your own and with the help of a mental healthcare professional to alleviate your stress. First, try to identify when your magical thinking takes place. Does it happen during times of stress or worry? You might find you rely the most on magical thinking when you are really concerned about the outcome of a situation. Try journaling about your worriesand the types of thoughts you have in response to your worries. Then, try writing down two to three practical things you can do to work toward your desired outcome. For instance, if you have an exam coming up, write down everything you can do to prepare, such as dedicating some time to studying each night, meeting with a study group, or making flashcards. If you get a good grade, you can look back on the list of things you did to prepare and give yourself credit—and realize that it wasn't your lucky pencil or excessive worrying that brought you good fortune. If you don't get the grade you want, review the test and see where you made mistakes. That will help give you specific action steps (which subjects to study more thoroughly) to get a better grade in the future. Over time, and as you become more confident about preparing yourself for stressful situations, you can learn to find comfort in being proactive and managing expectations. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)has been found to be effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder as well as helping people reframe their thoughts and feelings so they're more helpful in their everyday lives.4 Atherapistcan help you identify what types of magical thinking you engage in, as well as what situations trigger your magical thinking. They can even provide everyday exercises you can practice slowly weaning yourself off of using magical thinking to explain things that happen. In some cases, a mental health professional may recommend medication to decrease your GAD symptoms and help you better manage maladaptive thoughts and behaviors.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such asCelexa (citalopram)or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such asEffexor XR (venlafaxine), are considered the first line of medication for GAD. SSRIs function in the brain to increase levels ofserotonin—a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and anxiety. SSRIs may make stress more manageable, helping you feel less reliant on magical thinking in generalized anxiety disorder. Magical thinking is something that most of us do from time to time, and it is often harmless. However, if you feel that your magical thinking is interfering with your happiness or your day-to-day life, it may be helpful to seek professional advice. Ask a healthcare provider about what you can do to manage your magical thinking, especially if you have a mental health condition like generalized anxiety disorder.

Brianna Gilmartin / Verywell High-functioning anxiety is a catch-all term that refers to people who live with anxiety but identify as functioning reasonably well. It is not a recognized mental health diagnosis.1 If you have high-functioning anxiety, you appear to be successful, together, and calm—the typicalType A personalitywho excels at work and life.1However, the way you feel inside may be very different., Verywell / Brianna Gilmartin High-functioning anxiety typically propels the person forward rather than leaving them frozen in fear. As a result, they often appear very successful in work and life—which might be objectively true if that success is measured only in achievements. What others might not know (and what you would never share) is that beneath the surface of a seemingly perfect exterior, you're fighting a constant churn of anxiety. Here are a few other signs. You might be thepicture of success, arriving toworkearlier than everyone else, impeccably dressed, with your hair neatly styled. Coworkers might say you aredriven in your work: You've never missed a deadline or fallen short in a given task.1 It may have been nervous energy,fear of failure, and being afraid of disappointing others that drove you to success. Though you desperately need a day off work to get yourself together, you're often too afraid to call in sick. Nobody would ever believe something was wrong, because you always portrayed yourself as being fine. If these characteristics sound familiar, here's a look at what you might experience or what others might observe of you if you have high-functioning anxiety. On May 19, 2022, Verywell Mind hosted a virtual Mental Health in the Workplace webinar, hosted by Amy Morin, LCSW. If you missed it, check outthis recapto learn ways to foster supportive work environments and helpful strategies to improve your well-being on the job. People with high-functioning anxiety tend to always be willing to help others—partly because they're afraid of driving people away, being a bad friend/spouse/employee, or letting others down. Their social schedules tend to be busy and full. The potentialbenefits of high-functioning anxietycan be seen in the outcomes and successes that you and other people observe.2 Characteristics of people with high-functioning anxiety that are often thought of as positive include: In the case of high-functioning anxiety, a struggle often lies beneath that veil of success.2The anxiety you feel about your success inevitably must come out. Characteristics of high-functioning anxiety can be perceived by others as being ""cute"" or just part of your personality. In reality, these attributes are driven by underlying anxiety. Other characteristics of high-functioning anxiety are internal and might never be noticed by others—even though they cause you a great deal of stress. People don't know always know that these actions arecaused by anxietyand may view them as part of you who are. Despite being regarded as ""high-functioning,"" you may experience the following struggles in your day to day life. A high-functioning person is often regarded as an overachiever.2However, this perception is short-sighted because it fails to account for the struggle (and, perhaps, anxiety) required to achieve that level of success. If you asked most people who know you, they probably would not have a clue that you struggle with anxiety every day. Deep down, you know that your anxiety limits your life—even if you don't let on. Perhaps you are able to achieve essential tasks (such as those relating to work and housekeeping), but feel your life is limited in other ways (for example, you never do anything outside your comfort zone. Your actions are probably dictated by your anxiety. You likely choose activities that calm your racing thoughts rather than pursuing activities becauseyou would enjoy them, or because they would expand your horizons. If you have high-functioning anxiety, you've likely become adept at presenting a false persona to the world and never show your true feelings to anyone.2 Instead, you keep it all bottled up inside andcompartmentalizeyour feelings with a plan to deal with them later (but later never comes). The National Institutes of Mental Health lists five major types of anxiety: Anxiety has as many causes as people who have it. A few examples include: In some cases, you might not even know the source of youranxious feelings. An experienced therapist can help you figure that out. Help is available for people who are dealing with any form of anxiety, including high- functioning forms. However, certain characteristics of high-functioning anxiety might prevent you from seeking help. Some possible reasons you might not have sought help for high-functioning anxiety include: If you or a loved one are struggling with an anxiety disorder, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. Many people have a specific image or idea of what it means to have ananxiety diagnosis.4For example, you might envision a person who is housebound, cannot work, or who struggles to maintain relationships of any kind. We don't often think of the inner turmoil of anxiety as an internal struggle as being reason enough to seek help. Anxiety can be very much a life of denial. You might even convince yourself that there is nothing wrong—you're just a workaholic,germaphobe, list-maker, etc. It would be more helpful for us to refer to ""high-functioning anxiety"" as simply anxiety. While it can look and feel different from other types of anxiety, it's still present (even though it's well-hidden) and can seriously disrupt a person's life. When trying to raise awareness of a social issue like mental illness, it can be helpful to identify well-known or famous people as examples. Stars such as Barbra Streisand and Donny Osmond, and athletes like Zack Greinke and Ricky Williams, have all been forthcoming about their experiences with high-functioning anxiety.5 Scott Stossel, the national editor ofThe Atlantic,has written extensivelyabout his experiences with anxiety in the context of his achievements. There is little research on the topic of high-functioning anxiety, but we do know that there is an optimal level of anxiety (not too low or too high) that fuels performance (theYerkes-Dodson Law).6 Based on this concept, your ability to function at a higher level might be increased if you had a mild to moderate level of anxiety (as opposed to severe anxiety). IQ may also play a role in how well people with anxiety function in work and life. A 2005 study found that financial managers with high levels of anxiety made the best money managers—as long as they also hada high IQ.7 According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), around 19% of adults in the United States have an anxiety disorder.8Some people might consider themselves to be in the ""high-functioning"" category, but it's difficult to know exactly how many. It's recommended that all adults under the age of 65 be regularly screened for anxiety.9So, if you've never been diagnosed with a mental illness such as anxiety but you identify with the symptoms or characteristics, talk to your doctor. A medical professional you trust can provide support and give you a referral to be assessed by a mental health professional. If you are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder, know that there are effective treatment options. Anxiety disorders can be treated withcognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medications such asselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs), and even techniques likemindfulness training.10 Many people with anxiety find that using a combination of treatments best helps them manage their symptoms. If your anxiety symptoms do not meet the full diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorder, treatment with psychotherapy with or without medication may still be helpful. Whether you've already sought professional help or are still in the process, here are some tips you can try on your own toreduce your anxiety. Ask yourself why you hold on to your anxiety. Are you afraid that if you are no longer driven by anxiety, that you will stop being an overachiever?2 These are real concerns that you will need to address as you work on reducing the effect your anxiety has on your life. This will involve refuting the belief that you can't accomplish things without your anxiety. It may take some adjustment, but you will find a new groove that gives you a healthy balance between your mental well-being and getting things done. Thinking of anxiety in both its positive and negative terms can help you get past its lingeringstigma.4We all need some level of anxiety to get things done. Often,stereotypesand their resulting stigma take root when people don't understand what's happening or why, and this applies to anxiety disorders. Sharing your challenges with friends, family, and coworkers can help head off judgment and fear. Furthermore, sharing your coping strategies can help others recognize and deal with their own anxiety.

You might be afraid to let go of something that feels like it's part of your personality, but know that you don't need to be secretly anxious to achieve and succeed. Hold on to your positive traits through the habits that you've developed and try to let go of the tension and internal struggle your anxiety causes. Not only does success not need to be the result of struggle, but opening yourself up to your true feelings and sharing them with others can make your experience of life and the world around you more authentic.

https://www.verywellmind.com/how-anxiety-can-cause-relationship-problems-1393090,dynamic,Mental Health,Anxiety and Relationships,"Anxiety Can Lead to Overly-Dependent, Controlling, or Avoidant Behaviors Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Noel Hendrickson / Digital Vision / Getty Images Anxiety can negatively impact many aspects of your life, including your relationships. Not only can anxiety affect how you function in your daily life, but it can also interfere with your ability to communicate and connect with other people. Having ananxiety disordercan impact relationships in different ways. Understanding the different ways feelings of anxiety might interfere with your relationships can help you find ways to cope. This article explores a few specific ways in which your anxiety can lead to problems maintaining connections with others, as well as strategies you can implement (on your own or under the guidance of amental health professional) to help you navigate these unhealthy attachment patterns. There are a number of behaviors that people might engage in when they are experiencing anxiety in relationships. Some of these signs include: People won't necessarily experience or exhibit all of these symptoms to the same degree. The way that each person experiences anxiety in a relationship depends on the nature and severity of their anxiety condition. People who have anxiety disorders are more likely to be single and have higher rates of divorce.1 There are a few major ways that anxiety can impact a relationship. When you are experiencing feelings of anxiety, you may respond by being either too dependent or too avoidant. Both responses can take a toll on how you interact and communicate with others. Some people with anxiety have an intense desire for closeness to their partners (or friends), depending on them constantly for support and reassurance. Along with being overly dependent, people with anxiety may find themselves prone to:2 People with anxiety and overly dependentrelationshipsmay also struggle with anger toward those they feel dependent on, acting out in ways that are destructive to their relationships. People who have anxiety need to control every detail of their environment in order to manage stress and find peace. Below are a few signs that you are engaged in controlling behaviors in your relationships and daily routines to minimize your anxiety: On the other end of the spectrum, some people avoid relationships as a way of dealing with their anxiety. They may avoid negative emotions (for example, disappointment or frustration) by not revealing their feelings, opening up, or being vulnerable. A person who avoids close relationships may be perceived as cold, emotionally unavailable,lacking empathy, or even standoffish, even though they may long for closeness. One study found that people withsocial anxiety disorderwere less likely to receive support from their romantic partners and that less support and more severe anxiety symptoms increased the likelihood of breaking up.3 If anxiety is hurting your relationships, it is important to talk to a healthcare practitioner or mental health professional. There are treatments that can help youmanage your anxiety, improve your communication, and develop healthierinterpersonal relationships. Medication is often an essential part of anxiety treatment. While the medications prescribed for anxiety, likeselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are not curative, they can help decrease your symptoms and help you feel better as you rework your anxious thoughts and behaviors with your therapist. Medications are often most effective when they are used in conjunction with psychotherapy.4 Various types of therapy can helptreat anxiety disorders, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), andexposure therapy.Such therapies can also improve communication in relationships. A therapist who specializes in one type oftalk therapycalledcognitive-behavioral therapycan help you devise strategies to reassure yourself and take thoughtful action on your own instead of needing your partner for comfort each time you are anxious.5 If you find yourself being overly distant in your relationships, cognitive behavioral therapy, along with other types of therapy, such aspsychodynamic psychotherapy, may be helpful. A mental health professional can help one explore past and present relationships and the emotions surrounding those interpersonal connections.6 A therapist will also help you understand how anxiety impacts your relationships. For instance, exploring your emotions more deeply may be a good strategy for someone who tends to be avoidant. If you or a loved one are struggling with anxiety, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. In addition to professional help, there are also tactics and strategies that people can use to help manage feelings of anxiety when they are in a relationship. If you find yourself developing overly dependent attachments, developing ways to cope with youranxietyand relying more on yourself to feel better can take the pressure off your partner or friend. For instance, if you find yourself becoming angry or suspicious in these relationships, first remind yourself that your thoughts may be fueled by your anxiety. Then, take a few moments to think about any facts that support your worry and try to regain some perspective. Other techniques that might be helpful include: Sometimes, anxiety is overwhelming and debilitating, which can be extremely detrimental to relationships. Feelings of anxiety can also grow worse over time if left untreated, so reaching out for help is essential. Talk to a doctor or mental health professional if your symptoms of anxiety are causing distress or affecting important aspects of your life, including your daily activities and relationships. With proper treatment, you can develop healthy, long-lasting, and fulfilling connections with others. The first step is to identify what is behind your personal anxiety and look for ways to soothe yourself. It can also be helpful to talk about your anxiety with your partner or other loved ones. Develop routines that help minimize your stress and anxiety while practicing self-care and relaxation strategies to ease feelings of anxiety. People with anxiety may sometimes respond by either seeking reassurance or avoiding rejection. Seeking excessive reassurance can lead to clinginess or dependence, while fear of rejection might contribute to avoidance and other symptoms that negatively affect relationships with others. Anxiety can lead to excessive worry, anger, or irritability. Constantly seeking reassurance can be stressful for both people in the relationship and contribute to arguments. On the other hand, anxiety can also contribute to being overly controlling or becoming avoidant and detached, which makes it hard to form a meaningful connection.

https://www.verywellmind.com/how-does-caffeine-affect-anxiety-6748834,dynamic,Mental Health,Caffeine and Anxiety,"Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the ""Everything Psychology Book."" Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Mongkol Nitirojsakul / EyeEm / Getty Coffee, tea, soda, and other foods and beverages containingcaffeineare consumed by many adults each and every day, so it is perhaps not surprising to learn that caffeine is the most commonly used drug in the world.1Because caffeine is so intertwined in our daily diets, it is often easy to forget that it is a drug that, while legal, still has psychoactive effects. According to one study, 85% of the U.S. population consumes at least one caffeinated beverage every day.2 Increased alertness is one of the key attractions for many people, but elevated arousal levels are not always ideal, particularly if you have anxiety. If you are prone to anxiety or have an anxiety disorder, too much caffeine might exacerbate your symptoms, interfere with your sleep, and potentially induce feelings of panic in some people. This article discusses the impact caffeine can have on the body, including how it can affect anxiety. It also explores what you can do if you think that your caffeine intake might be contributing to feelings of anxiety. To understand how caffeine can affect anxiety, it is important to first understand what anxiety is and the symptoms it can cause. Anxiety can be a normal reaction to stressful life events, and to a certain degree, it can help prepare your body to deal with environmental threats. But too much anxiety can lead to intense and excessive fear and worrying about everyday events. Common symptoms of anxiety can include: Specific patterns of symptoms depend on the type of anxiety disorder a person is experiencing. Such anxiety disorders can include: Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in many plants, including coffee beans, tea leaves, cacao pods, and kola nuts. It can also be produced synthetically and added to medications, beverages, and foods. Caffeine stimulates thecentral nervous system, making you feel more alert and energetic after consuming it. It also has several other effects on the body, including acting as a diuretic, which increases urination and removes salt and fluids from the body. It can also interfere with the absorption of calcium, increase blood pressure, and increase the release of stomach acid. How a person reacts to caffeine varies from one person to the next and depends on a variety of factors, including genetics, body mass, metabolism, and the quantity consumed. Caffeine's effects typically begin around an hour after consuming it, and the effects may last up to six hours. While caffeine is not harmful in moderate amounts, consuming too much can lead to unpleasant side effects and health problems. Some of theseside effects of caffeineinclude:3 Giving up caffeine can also cause symptoms ofcaffeine withdrawal, including headaches and fatigue.4 If the side effects of too much caffeine sound familiar, it might be because these effects are very similar to symptoms of anxiety. It isn’t uncommon for people to mistake caffeine’s side effects for feelings of an anxiety attacks. Symptoms of anxiety and the effects of caffeine affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of theautonomic nervous systemthat controls the body's fight-or-flight response. Thefight-or-flight responserefers to the way your body mobilizes and responds to threats in the environment. When activated, this response triggers a host of physiological and psychological reactions, including increased respiration, blood pressure, and muscle tension. The effects of consuming too much caffeine can often feel indistinguishable from anxiety symptoms. And if you already have an anxiety condition, evidence indicates that it can worsen your symptoms. One 2022 study found that caffeine doses equivalent to five cups of coffee could inducepanic attacksin a large portion of people with panic disorder. The study also found that caffeine didn't just increase anxiety levels in people with panic disorder—healthy adults reported more anxiety as well.5 TheDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR)also recognizes caffeine-induced anxiety disorder as a distinct condition. It is a subclass ofsubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorderand is characterized by experiencing anxiety or panic attacks as a direct result of caffeine consumption.6 Caffeine use may also contribute to anxiety problems in other ways. For example, it can lead to sleep disturbances. Poor sleep can, in turn, play a part in the onset and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Research has found that problems with sleep are a predictor for the onset of generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents.7 Some animal studies have also shown that long-term caffeine use might permanently alter brain excitability.8Such effects may be more pronounced among adolescents who habitually consume excessive amounts of caffeine, leading to an increased risk of developing anxiety.9 Caffeine can worsen symptoms of anxiety and interfere with sleep. Some research indicates that chronic caffeine use might increase your risk for developing an anxiety disorder. It is also important to be aware of how caffeine use might impact medications that are utilized to treat anxiety disorders. Drug interactions can occur, which may cause unwanted side effects or impact how well youranxiety medicationworks. Treatment for anxiety often involves psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two. If your doctor prescribes a medication to treat your anxiety, it is important to understand how caffeine might interact with your medications and the effect it might have on your anxiety symptoms. Medications that are commonly prescribed to treat anxiety include: Interactions may occur depending on the type of medication you are taking. For example, if you are using a benzodiazepine medication such as Xanax, caffeine may counteract the depressant effects of the drug, causing the two to cancel each other out. Caffeine can reduce the efficacy of beta blockers. You should avoid caffeinated products if you are taking these medications.12 Some research suggests that caffeine can increase the antidepressant effects of some medications, including Wellbutrin and other common antidepressants such as Prozac and Lexapro.13This interaction may potentially lead to increased side effects while taking these antidepressants.14 If your doctor prescribes an anxiety medication, always talk to them about potential drug interactions. Ask if it is safe to consume caffeine while you are taking your medication and about any potential adverse affects you might experience. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the typical dose of caffeine is around 400 mg per day.15This equals about four cups of coffee per day. Consuming more than 400 mg a day may result in adverse effects. However, if you are sensitive to the effects of caffeine or have a condition that might be worsened by caffeine, such as anxiety, you might experience problems at even lower doses. If you are concerned about how caffeine is affecting your anxiety symptoms, there are things you can do to cut back on how much you are consuming each day. The first step is to be aware of your caffeine intake. Check labels to see how much caffeine is in the foods, beverages, and medications you consume. Amounts found in some frequently consumed beverages include:15 Once you know more about your caffeine sources, gradually reduce your daily intake. Cutting back slowly can help minimize the risk of unpleasant withdrawal effects. As you reduce your dose, look for lower-caffeine or caffeine-free substitutes. For example, you might opt for herbal teas or decaffeinated coffee. If you are struggling with feelings of anxiety, it is always a good idea to consider if caffeine might be playing a part in worsening your symptoms. Lifestyle modifications such as cutting back on caffeine, getting enough sleep, and engaging in regular exercise may help you better manage your anxiety, but it is also important to talk to a doctor or mental health professional. Effective treatments can help you deal with anxiety and prevent it from worsening. If you or a loved one are struggling with anxiety, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-anxiety-hives-5094930,dynamic,Mental Health,Anxiety Hives,"Too much anxiety can lead to itchy, red stress hives Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the ""Everything Psychology Book."" Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, is an award-winning physician-scientist and clinical development specialist. Verywell / Theresa Chiechi Hives are puffy, raised welts that most commonly appear on the skin as a result of an allergic reaction, but there are actually a number of different things that can cause people to break out in hives, includinganxiety. When this happens, people can develop an itchy rash on the skin known as an anxiety rash (sometimes called anxiety hives or a stress rash). Stress is a normal part of daily life. But when thatstress goes unchecked, or when it's actually undiagnosed anxiety, it can come with a host of negative side effects. If you have hives and cannot pinpoint any other cause, anxiety could be the culprit and it's worth consulting a doctor or mental health professional to confirm. Anxiety can have physical effects, including on your skin. Those itchy, red welts you might get when you are feeling really stressed and anxious can be annoying and uncomfortable. However, it's important to remember that rashes and hives can have other causes, so be sure to rule out other causes. If stress and anxiety are the cause, there are steps you can take tomanage your stress responseand reduce the likelihood of developing a stress rash. Stress rashes often appear as hives, also known as urticaria, which tend to be: Hives can appear anywhere on the body. However, an anxiety rash on the face, neck, and chest are some of the most common. While they may initially start as tiny red bumps like a typical rash, stress rashes often become larger welts or patches that worsen after scratching them. Individual hives can be as large as dinner plates, but smaller hives can also merge so that they appear to cover a large portion of the body.5 Most anxiety rashes disappear within 24 hours; however, if you're still seeing hives after a couple of days, it's recommended that you consult a dermatologist.6 Hives are often the result of an allergic reaction to something in your environment. But emotional stress can cause a rash, too. This is because stress can trigger a response in the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of histamine. Histamine is a compound that is normally produced by the body in response to injury, allergies, and inflammatory reactions, but it can also betriggered by stress. Most commonly, hives are a result of one of the following causes: If you've ruled out these common causes, it's possible that stress is a factor. If you are experiencing hives, you should start by assessing your activities over the last few days. Any unusual changes in your routine or exposure to new things might play a role in triggering hives. Some questions you might ask yourself to help pinpoint the cause include: If you cannot pinpoint another cause and you have been experiencing a great deal of stress, your hives might be a stress rash. Stress rashes tend to appear most commonly in women during their 30s, 40s, and 50s. People who have had allergic hives in the past are also at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety hives. If you are experiencing a stress rash, it's important to find ways to relieve your immediate symptoms in the short-term while also looking for ways to lower your stress over the long term. You can ease some of the uncomfortable physical symptoms of hives by wearing loose-fitting clothing and avoiding hot water. Topical steroids such as hydrocortisone cream and applying cold compresses can also help relieve the itching and irritation caused by the hives. Some topical treatments such as oatmeal baths14or applying aloe vera15to a stress rash may help reduce inflammation. However, it's best to check with a doctor prior to treating your rash at home.

Her work spans various health-related topics, including mental health, fitness, nutrition, and wellness. PeopleImages / Getty Images We tend to think ofanxietyas a condition that provokes emotions like unease, worry, fear, stress, and panic. However, it’s important to understand that anxiety disorders are in fact health conditions that can cause physical symptoms as well. Everyone experiences these symptoms differently. For instance, you may have butterflies in your stomach before a bigtestor meeting. Or, you may feel slightly queasy at the prospect of taking a flight or riding in a crowded elevator. In severe cases, your stomach may churn, you may get stomach cramps, or you may end up gagging, dry heaving, or throwing up when faced with anxiety-provoking situations, such aspublic speaking. While it’s normal to feelanxiousfrom time to time, anxiety that is persistent and overwhelming can make it difficult for you to go about your daily life. Symptoms like nausea can make anxiety harder to cope with. This article explores the physical effects of anxiety, theconnection between nausea and anxiety, and some treatment options and coping strategies. Some of thephysical symptoms of anxietyinclude sweating, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, tense muscles, nausea, and other digestive issues, saysAlexandra Fuss, PhD, a gastrointestinal psychologist at Yale School of Medicine. Fuss explains how anxiety triggers a flight, fight, or freeze response in your body and the connection between anxiety and nausea. Anxiety causes the body to activate the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our fight, flight, or freeze response to a threat. When we are faced with a threat or stressor, oursympathetic nervous systemreleases stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. When we are in this state, our body prioritizes its resources to give us the best chance of immediate survival. We experience physical symptoms such as sweating, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and increased blood pressure. Additionally, blood is diverted away from the digestive system to the large muscle groups, digestion is slowed, and immune system responses are altered. The brain and gut are interlinked and each can influence the other. Our bowel walls haveneurons(nerve cells) that comprise ourentericnervous system, also known as the gastrointestinal nervous system. This system is linked to our central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord. This connection is a bi-directional network, which means that each can affect the other. In one direction, the brain can provoke intestinal responses to thoughts and emotions. In the other direction, the gut can trigger a response within the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain. Essentially, anxious thoughts and emotions can impact digestive functioning and similarly, digestive functioning can impact our emotions and thinking. As a result, it is not uncommon for people to feel that familiar stomachache or nausea when they are anxious. In turn, that nausea can worsen the anxiety. If your anxiety is causing you to feel nauseous, here are some tips that can help relieve nausea:1 Fuss suggests some treatment options and coping strategies that can help you cope with anxiety and subsequent nausea you experience: Anxiety is a health condition that can cause severe physical and psychological symptoms. Nausea is one of the physical symptoms of anxiety that can be difficult to cope with and worsen your anxiety. In the short-term, you can take steps to relieve the nausea and feel better. Sipping on chilled drinks, eating toast or a saltine cracker, and resting comfortably can help. However, in the long-term, it’s important to take steps totreat the anxietyand the subsequent nausea you experience. Seek help from a mental healthcare professional, for treatment options and coping strategies that can address your anxiety and prevent or manage nausea.

https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-prevent-vomiting-5203993,dynamic,Coping Strategies,Preventing Vomiting,"Learn 7 ways to prevent vomiting Toketemu has been multimedia storyteller for the last four years. Her expertise focuses primarily on mental wellness and women’s health topics. Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, is an award-winning physician-scientist and clinical development specialist. Vomiting is an unpleasant and inconvenient experience. It might be brought on by food poisoning, early signs of pregnancy, or simply because you are dealing with a bad hangover. It can also be brought on by anxiety, stress, or atraumatic experience. Throwing up is your body's way of ridding itself of substances it deems poisonous or those that it is unable to digest, but sometimes your body has the urge to throw up more than is actually necessary. This is why it can be helpful to know a few strategies to lower your need to vomit. Here are some steps you can take to lower your likelihood of throwing up: martin-dm / E+ / Getty Before trying to stop from throwing up, a great place to start is to find out why the contents of your stomach are coming up in the first place. This is especially important because throwing up might be a symptom of an underlying condition. The most common causes of vomiting are:1 If your vomiting is occurring alongside other symptoms such as headaches, pain, or tremors, it could be a sign of the following:1 If you feel the urge to throw up in a safe and clean space, it’s best to go ahead and do so, especially if the cause of your vomiting is food poisoning or consuming too much alcohol. These are some techniques to help you stop yourself from throwing up if you are in a public space or if it’s simply inconvenient to do so at that moment: This might seem like a no-brainer, but sometimes it can make all the difference between simplyfeeling nauseousand finding yourself with your head stuck down a toilet bowl. If you had been standing when your nausea hit, then take a seat because lying down flat may cause you to vomit. Also, limit all physical activity; being in motion may only exacerbate your nausea. Sipping on a sweet drink like a Gatorade or ginger ale could help alleviate your nausea and stop you from throwing up. Some research shows that ginger has excellent antinausea properties that could help people prone to nausea or vomiting feel better. A 2014 study on the effects of ginger on nausea and vomiting in women in theearly stage of their pregnanciesfound that ginger root was an effective, non-medical way to relieve nausea.3 If you do not have ginger tea but find some ginger in your kitchen, you could peel it up, put it in a cup of warm water, and sip on it. Chewing on some ice chipscan help relieve nausea and stop you from throwing up. If you are in a place where ice chips aren’t readily available, sipping on an icy bottle of water or a non-acidic drink can also help prevent vomiting.4 If you find yourself on the brink of throwing up, you have to be extra careful about what you eat. Ideally, you should avoid eating until you feel better, but if you must eat, eat only bland foods like a piece of toast. Avoid any spicy or oily foods that could make you feel worse. Some people find themselves with an urge to throw up in a stressful situation or when they are anxious. For people in these scenarios,deep breathing exercisescould help stop them from throwing up. Deep breathing exercises also work great for people who have motion sickness. Sometimes, feeling like throwing up might have more to do with the environment you are in than with what’s going on in your body. If you are in a crowded room with little ventilation and suddenly feel the urge to throw up,try stepping outside for a bit. If you were able to temporarily stave the vomit away but eventually end up throwing up, here are a couple of things you can do to find some relief: If any of the remedies above aren’t helping stop your vomiting, it might be time to speak to a healthcare provider about it. You should also seek medical attention if you notice any blood in your vomit. In most cases, feeling nauseous or throwing up is nothing to fuss about. The feeling typically passes in no time. However, if you are exhibiting other worrying symptoms such as headaches, severe pain, weakness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, you should see a healthcare provider. While stopping yourself from throwing up might be convenient in certain scenarios, it’s not always the best choice. If it’s convenient, it’s always best to let nausea and vomiting just run their course naturally. However, if you've been vomiting and can’t figure out what’s causing it, you should speak to a medical professional. Cleveland Clinic.Nausea & Vomiting.

https://www.verywellmind.com/9-things-to-do-if-you-feel-anxious-5087875,dynamic,Coping Strategies,Dealing with Anxiety,"Here are 9 ways to cope with anxiety Sara Lindberg, M.Ed., is a writer focusing on mental health, fitness, nutrition, and parenting. Jamie Grill/Getty Images Everyone goes through periods offeeling anxiousand worried. After all, it’s a normal human experience. Having tools to help you calm your mind and body can reduce the intensity and duration of these feelings. Here are nine strategies that can relax your mind, ease your anxiety, and help you regain control of your thoughts so that you can feel better. While not a specific strategy, understanding the connection between anxiety and depression can help you determine if what you’re dealing with is temporary or a sign of something more serious. According toLeela R. Magavi, MD, a psychiatrist and regional medical director forCommunity Psychiatry, anxiety and depression are intertwined and frequently exacerbate each other. Part of the reason, she said, is because the same neurochemicals are implicated in both conditions. More specifically,Julian Lagoy,MD, a psychiatrist withCommunity Psychiatry, explained that since decreased serotonin causes bothdepression and anxiety, it’s common for someone with depression to also feel anxious at the same time. That’s why it’s critical to acknowledge feelings of anxiety and share them with an expert, especially if you’ve been diagnosed with depression or are showing signs of depression. Acknowledging when you feel anxious allows you to take steps to ease the symptoms. The first step is to accept that you cannot control everything. To do this, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) recommends putting feelings of stress or anxiety in perspective.1 When you have an anxious thought that won’t go away, ask yourself: “Is it really as bad as I think?” Take yourself through the process of breaking down the thought before jumping to the worst-case scenario. If you still answer yes, ask yourself the following: This exercise is helpful for people who deal with chronic anxiety and worry. It may sound counterintuitive when looking at strategies to help you find relief fromanxiety, but allowing yourself a short worry break each day can free up your energy to focus on the task at hand. How you set this up depends on your routine. One way to take a worry break is to schedule a chunk of time later in the day, maybe 15 minutes after dinner, to go through your worries for the day. Earlier in the day, you can write down any worries or anxieties that creep into your mind. Then, give yourself permission to deal with them later. This allows you to go about your day while still acknowledging that something is bothering you. Later, when you go over the worry list, make sure to set a timer. Review what you wrote, identify any thoughts that are still causing anxiety, and cross off those that don’t seem important anymore. Allow yourself a few minutes to sit with each concern. Whennegative thoughtsor excessive worries run through your head, it can feel like there is no way to turn them off. One strategy to try is interrupting your anxious thoughts by doing something else. While it might not work every time, you may find that taking a break from overthinking can lead to fewerintrusive thoughtsthroughout the day. Here are some techniques to try: Mindfulness meditation, relaxation and breathing exercises can help calm your mind and body, which may allow you to feel less worried.2 Plus, it only takes a few minutes each day to feel a difference. Use this time to be aware of what’s going on in your mind and body. Start with five minutes a day and work your way up to mindful moments several times a day. To help you get started, listen to a guided meditation, or recorded breathing exercises. Once you feel comfortable with the practice, you will find more focus and awareness throughout the day. Engaging in diaphragmatic breathing and registering bodily cues could help you better understand your emotional response to stress, according to Magavi. Many people who experience anxiety find it helpful to partake in guided body scan meditations while breathing slowly and deeply to identify how each emotion triggers disparate sensations in their body, Magavi said. You can use this information to think about how to respond verbally or behaviorally. She recommends using diaphragmatic breathing and pranayama, which is alternative breathing or the practice of breath control. When you’re feeling anxious and want to take your mind off the stressor, Lagoy says to carve out time to do the things you love like: Feeling anxious isn’t always a bad thing. In fact, anxious thoughts could be yourbody’s way of giving you valuable information. The next time you feel worried, fearful, stressed, or have overwhelming thoughts of dread, stop and take a deep breath. Instead of defaulting to “this is my anxiety talking,” reframe how you view the situation and ask yourself if your body is trying to tell you something. Do you need to slow down? Maybe you’re getting sick, and your body is responding to stress. Or maybe, there is a real threat, and you need to take action. Sometimes the best thing you can do is to call or text a friend, partner, or family member. Maybe you just want to vent or maybe you want to be distracted for a bit—a loved one can help you feel like you're not alone and shift your attention to something other than the source of your anxiety. Keep in mind that, even though loved ones mean well, they could make your anxiety worse especially if they start freaking out too. So, if you go this route, make sure to choose someone who's known to be calm and won't add to your anxiety. Occasional bouts of anxiety and worry may just be a sign that you need to take a break and implement some of the strategies listed above. Adding exercise, meditation, diaphragmatic breathing, or a worry break into your day may help ease your mind. But if anxiety, nervousness, or worrying becomes excessive or begins to impact your life, it might be time to seek professional help.

Verywell / Laura Porter It’s normal to worry from time to time. Given life's many unknowns and challenges, worry is a natural response to many situations. However, chronic and all-consuming worry can be troublesome and interfere with our ability to function freely and calmly in our daily lives.1 Thinking about the future is normal, but lying awake at night fretting about upcoming events isn't healthy. If you are trying to stop worrying about the future: Let's explore more helpful tips to reduce your worrisome and negative thoughts. This episode ofThe Verywell Mind Podcastshares how to stop worrying about things you can't control. Click below to listen now. Follow Now:Apple Podcasts/Spotify/Google Podcasts/Amazon Music While you might be tempted to tell yourself, ""Don't worry,"" this usually isn't a helpful strategy. Trying not to think about someone often makes it loom even larger in your mind. Instead of denying your thoughts, acknowledge them.Accept that these worries are realwithout judging or trying to change them. This doesn't mean that you're giving up or resigning yourself to a life of worry. Instead, it means that you are aware of what you are feeling.2 Sometimes, simply labeling your feelings can help those emotions and worries seem less intense.3 Stress is a natural response to uncertainty. When we're in a new situation or facing confusing circumstances, it's normal to feel worried about what the future may hold. These feelings help us anticipate what may come and may even motivate us. In small amounts,stress can be beneficial. When thatstress becomes chronic, however, we may start to see negative effects on our mental and physical well-being.4Worrying too much can also cause us toavoid the things we find stressful, which can worsen anxiety.5 People who worry chronically may also perceive things differently from others. They mayanticipate that negative thingswill happen more often and may show a heightened response to real and perceived threats.6 Some amount of stress and worry are normal, but chronic anxiety about the future can have a detrimental effect on your health and well-being. When you find yourself worrying about a future event because you are picturing a negative outcome, you are, in effect, saying, ""I can predict the future."" But, the fact is, you can’t, and you are worried about whatmayhappen, not whatwillhappen. Worry itself serves no purpose unless it spurs a plan of action.7 So how can you stop fortune telling? Behavioral experiments are one way to test out your negative predictions. Instead of trying to predict the future, take action. Intentionally put yourself in the situation you are worried about to see if your predictions come true. As you gain more experience and see that your predictions are not accurate predictors of reality, your feelings of worry and anxiety will gradually begin to diminish. If your mind has been taken over by chronic worry, your risk assessment skills may be distorted.8You may even find yourself consumed with worry about future possibilities when there isn’t any real evidence that the negative event will actually come to pass. For example, perhaps you constantly worry about your job performance and fear being fired, but you have received no indication from your boss, or anyone else, that you’re not performing up to par. Looking at your situation realistically may help you reduce your worry. Some people find it helpful to schedule 15 to 30 minutes each day just to worry. If worrisome thoughts creep in at any other time, put them aside by telling yourself you have a scheduled time to worry. Your goal is to worry only during your scheduled 30 minutes each day. By setting aside a specific block of time just to worry, you can prevent these worries from creeping into your thoughts during the day. This may help you feel less stressed and can give you the incentive you need to tackle those problems during your designatedworry time. One way to stop worrying about the future is to focus more on the present.Mindfulnessis a practice that can help people pay more attention to the here and now. It involves focusing on the present moment and building a greater self-awareness of how you feel in the moment. Need a breather? Take this free9-minute meditation focused on being present—or choose from ourguided meditation libraryto find another one that will help you feel your best. You can practice mindfulness by paying more attention to what is happening at the moment. Notice how you feel and focus on sensory experiences. Be present and take these feelings. If you start to experience worrying thoughts, notice and acknowledge them before returning your attention to the moment. As you practice this, you'll get better at controlling your attention and focusing on what's in front of you instead of stressing out about things that haven't happened yet. Write down your worrisome and distressful thoughts. Alongside each worrisome thought, list some positive substitution statements. For example, if you worry that your plane may crash during upcoming air travel, you may counter this thought with: ""Statistically, air travel is safe. Professional and competent airline staff are in control, and I can just relax and enjoy my trip."" You can also try usingthought-stoppingto quiet your worrisome mind.9 By learning and practicingrelaxation techniques, you will be able to reduce intrusive worry. Some techniques that may be helpful include:10 Social support can also be important when you are dealing with stress and worry. A friend can listen to your worries and may even be able to help problem-solve the issues you are dealing with. In other cases, you might just need a distraction from whatever it is that's stressing you out. Before you start your conversation, it can be helpful to let your friend know what you need. Tell them if you just need someone to listen, to help, or to take your mind off of your troubles. One thing to be wary of, however, is the tendency toco-ruminatewith friends. Such discussions, where you talk about an issue endlessly without getting any closer to a solution, can magnify your worries. If you find yourself engaging in this type of contagious worry, look for ways to redirect the conversation toward something more productive and helpful. If chronic worrying is getting in the way of your everyday life, it may be time to seek professional help. A therapist may be able to help you get to the bottom of your worrying and learn skills and techniques to cope. Ask your doctor for a referral or do an online search for a therapist in your area who specializes incognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a technique that can help you identify and change negative thoughts that contribute to stress, worry, and anxiety.Online therapycan also be effective. We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of thebest online therapy programsincluding Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. Worry is a normal part of life, but chronic or excessive worry can negatively impact your health and well-being. Learning stress-reduction and relaxation techniques can help you get the symptoms of chronic worrying under control. Cognitive skills like avoiding fortune-telling, replacing negative thoughts, and scheduling a time to worry can also offer benefits.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Verywell / Theresa Chiechi Anxiety is a normal part of life as everyone feels some level of worry or unease from time to time. But if you are experiencing severe anxiety that feels overwhelming or out of control, it could be asign of a mental health disorder—and anxiety-based mental health issues are highly treatable.1 Learn more about what extreme anxiety is, as well as the difference between normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder. We also share things you can do if you feel like your anxiety is negatively impacting your life, including several steps you can take to find relief from severe anxiety. 'Extreme anxiety' is a phrase that people use to describe feelings of worry, panic, or fear that are intense or out of proportion to an actual threat. It's important to understand that this term is not a clinical term ormental illness diagnosis. How people experience anxiety can differ from one person to the next. One person may feel like they have small butterflies in their stomach, while another might have severe anxiety in the form of a panic attack. You can also experience different levels of anxiety at different points in time. If you are experiencingcrippling anxietythat makes it difficult to function in various areas of your life—including work, school, and relationships—you might have an anxiety disorder. Not all anxiety is bad. In fact, normal levels ofanxiety can be beneficialby helping you better respond to stresses in your environment. For example, research has found that increased levels of anxiety can help you move faster and with greater accuracy when faced with a stressful task.2 The difference between normal anxiety and extreme anxiety is how it affects your ability to function and the level of distress that it creates.3When anxiety is extreme or severe, it makes it difficult, if not impossible for you to function normally in certain situations. With severe anxiety, you may not be able to work or socialize like you normally would. It can also create such extreme distress that you begin to altogether avoid situations that are likely to trigger these feelings. If your anxiety is severe in duration or intensity, negatively impacting your life, or increasing over time, you may have ananxiety disorder.3Only a physician or mental health professional can diagnose anxiety disorders, but there are both physical and mental symptoms to watch for. Extreme anxiety can show up in your body physically, in the form of: Severe anxiety can also impact you mentally or emotionally, resulting in symptoms such as: If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat988for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. Extreme anxiety can also manifest as a panic attack.Panic attacksare characterized by an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by a variety of physical sensations, including:4 There are many different types of anxiety disorders. If you have one of these disorders, your healthcare provider or therapist can evaluate your symptoms to determine which type you have. Anxiety is one of the most common mental health conditions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) reports that 19.1% of adults in the United States experience an anxiety disorder each year, and an estimated 31.1% will experience this type of disorder at some point during their lives.7 Anxiety disorders also tend to be more prevalent among women. Women are twice as likely as men to be affected by an anxiety disorder, so experts suggest that women and girls aged 13 and older be screened for anxiety during regular health exams.8 If anxiety is making it difficult to function normally or creating significant distress in your life, it's important to get help. Severe anxiety typically will not go away on its own and often worsens over time. Plus, many of the coping strategies that people use to decrease anxiety—such as avoidance—end up making the issue worse.9 Fortunately, anxiety can be treated in a number of psychotherapeutic ways. Medications may also be prescribed to decrease anxiety symptoms or treat co-occurring conditions. Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) is an evidence-based treatment approach that works by helping people identify and change theautomatic negative thoughtsthat contribute to feelings of anxiety.10During treatment, people also learn to identify the situations that trigger anxiety, work on changing their avoidance behaviors, and practice relaxation techniques to reduce feelings of anxiety. Exposure therapyis another approach used for treating anxiety, and it often results in positive outcomes.11This technique involves being gradually and progressively exposed to what it is the individual fears in a safe, controlled way. During this exposure, people also learn to practice relaxation techniques. Over time, the thing that triggers the fear elicits less of a response and people are better able to tolerate it without experiencing anxiety or panic. Anxiety medicationscan also be used to help people manage their symptoms. Depending on your situation, your healthcare or mental health provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine or antidepressant such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) to relieve your feelings of anxiousness. For many people, the best approach is a combination of anxiety medications and psychotherapy. Most of the time, using both anxiety treatments at the same time can greatly improve your quality of life.12 Living with severe anxiety can present a number of challenges, but there are a few self-help strategies you can use to help manage your symptoms.

https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-doomscrolling-5088882,dynamic,Mental Health,Doomscrolling and Anxiety,"Shelby Deering is a Madison, Wisconsin-based lifestyle writer specializing in mental health topics ranging from depression to anxiety disorders. Rachel Goldman, PhD FTOS, is a licensed psychologist, clinical assistant professor, speaker, wellness expert specializing in eating behaviors, stress management, and health behavior change. Boy_Anupong / Getty Images According to psychotherapist and coachTess Brigham, MFT, doomscrolling is mindlessly scrolling through negative news articles, social media posts, or other content-sharing platforms. Essentially, it's reading one negative story after another. One Canadian study has even called this phenomenon “social media panic.”1 Although it may seem as if 2020 and all its hurdles (the COVID-19 pandemic, political tensions, and social injustice, to name a few) inspired the term “doomscrolling,” it actually likely sprung up on Twitter in 2018, and has been a cultural term ever since. If you’ve spent several minutes or perhaps even hours engrossed in reading stories or posts online—and they tend to be of the distressing variety—it’s likely that you’ve spent your time doomscrolling. Doomscrolling occurs when you realize you’ve landed on a story and have no idea how you got there. You can’t remember why you even got on your phone in the first place, but now you’re reading hundreds of comments or retweets of someone you don’t even follow. Brigham says that those who struggle with anxiety oranxiety-related disorders(these can include panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], and social anxiety disorder) are especially prone to doom scroll because “anxiety is about control or the lack of control.” “The more anxious we feel, the more we try and control the situations and people around us,"" says Brigham. ""Being informed seems like a good way to control what’s happening around us, but it actually just creates more anxiety and fear.” If deep down it’s affecting our mental health in a negative way, why do we continue to doom scroll? “People doom scroll for many different reasons,” Brigham says. “The main reason is as a way of feeling in control in a world that feels so out of control all the time.” She points to a feeling of, “If I know what’s happening, I can be better prepared when things get bad,” as a reason for doomscrolling. The fear is that something terrible might happen that you don’t see coming; doomscrolling seems to be an effective way to stay prepared. “We are hardwired to survive and to see the things that could potentially harm us,” Brigham further explains. “That’s in our DNA, and our ancestors needed this ability in order to literally survive. While our world is very different, we still have this drive to keep ourselves safe, which we think we’re doing by reading negative news stories.” Daily doomscrolling isn’t a wise idea if you’re striving for good mental health. “It’s bad for your mental health because there is no real benefit to doomscrolling,” Brigham notes. “It only makes you more anxious and paranoid about the world around you.” Brigham also says that doomscrolling robs you of living in thepresent moment, since it’s a “mindless” activity. Doomscrolling prevents you from paying attention to your thoughts and feelings, which is additionally detrimental to mental health. And, you may not even be fully conscious of how much it’s impacting you. “While you’re scrolling through all these articles,” she says, “you may not be aware of how all of this negative information is affecting your psyche, but once you close your eyes and try and go to bed, your mind is spinning with terrible images.” As tempting as it is to consistently consume negative news stories, there are ways to turn scrolling into a positive experience. “One way to make it positive is to only visit sites you trust to report on events in a fair manner,” Brigham says. “Some news sites are just sensational and want to shock or scare you, so avoid those outlets and focus on places where you know you’ll get honest, accurate information. Limit your intake. You can stay informed by watching one show or even reading a summary of the news of the day,""  says Brigham. If you’ve found yourself in a swirling vortex of doomscrolling that takes place multiple times a day, it’s time to do a mental health check-in and apply Brigham’s tips and tricks so you won’t go down the rabbit hole.

Verywell / Madelyn Goodnight An adjustment disorder is defined by difficulty adjusting to life stressors.Movingto a new city, changes in a relationship, or shifting to a new career are just a few examples of stressors that may cause someone to experience mood or behavioral disturbances. For more than 50 years, clinicians have been using the term to describe individuals who are struggling to deal with a particular stressful situation or ongoing circumstance that causes distress. Adjustment disorders are among the most commonly diagnosed mental health issues and they may be diagnosed in children, adolescents, and adults. Most studies report about 1% of the population may have an adjustment disorder at any given time.1 According to theDSM-5, the newest diagnostic manual used by clinicians to diagnose mental illness, the criteria for adjustment disorder includes: The symptoms must not persist for more than six months after the stressor has ended. They must also be out of proportion for the person’s culture and cannot represent normalbereavement. The disturbance also must not meet criteria for another mental disorder (likedepressionoranxiety). Clinicians specify how the symptoms affect an individual’s functioning by indicating if the adjustment disorder is: An adjustment disorder with anxiety is marked by nervousness, worrying, jitteriness, or separation anxiety.  Here are some examples of times when an adjustment disorder diagnosis may be warranted: Adjustment disorders can stem from a variety of stressful situations and experiences. Some of them may be single events, like a natural disaster, changing jobs, moving to a new city, or getting married. At other times, adjustment disorders stem from ongoing difficulties, like the stress associated with launching a business or moving away to college. It’s not always clear why some individuals adjust to stressful circumstances more easily than others. Even when an entire family or group of children are exposed to the same stressful situation, some may develop adjustment disorders while others don’t. While any stressful life circumstance can place you at risk of developing an adjustment disorder, the way you cope with the stress plays a role in whether you develop an adjustment disorder. Additionally, these factors may also impact your adjustment: Yes. In fact, pre-existing mental health issues like depression and anxiety may place you at a higher risk of developing an adjustment disorder.  There isn’t a specific test used to diagnose adjustment disorders. Instead, a physician or mental health professional will conduct an interview to assess your symptoms. A physician may run routine tests to ensure your symptoms aren’t caused by an underlying health issue. Once a physician rules out medical illnesses, you may be referred to a mental health professional for further assessment. A mental health professional may ask you to complete some forms or questionnaires so information can be gathered efficiently. You may also be interviewed about your symptoms and the stressful life experience you encountered (you might not recognize a stressful life experience causing the adjustment disorder). The clinician will use the DSM-5 to determine if you meet the criteria for an adjustment disorder based on the information you provided. Many people with adjustment disorders find that treatment helps ease their distress and assists them in moving past a stressful event in a more productive, helpful way. Treatment often consists of talk therapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Talk therapyis typically the preferred course of treatment for an adjustment disorder. The type of therapy used may depend on the therapist’s expertise and the individual’s needs. In general, talk therapy may provide emotional support, assist with identifying healthy coping skills, teach stress management strategies, and help you establish healthy habits. If you’re the parent or partner of someone with an adjustment disorder, you may be invited to attend therapy as well. Family therapy may teach you the best way to support an individual who is experiencing an adjustment disorder. Medication may be used to address depression or anxiety that accompanies an adjustment disorder. Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication may only be needed for a short time but make sure to speak with your physician before adjusting any dosages or discontinuing any medications. If you notice you aren’t bouncing back from a stressful event as well as you might like, you can take steps to improve your resilience and help you feel better. These strategies may help you cope with the adjustment issues you’re experiencing: If you’re struggling to feel better on your own, reach out to a mental health professional who can assist you in finding strategies that help you feel better. It’s likely that most people will experience an adjustment disorder at one point or another in their lives. It’s not a sign of weakness. If you’re struggling don’t beat yourself up by thinking you should be doing better. Instead, get proactive about taking care of yourself and seek professional help to support your efforts.

https://www.verywellmind.com/gad-and-adjustment-disorder-1393126,dynamic,Mental Health,GAD and Adjustment Disorder,"Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. People experiencingsignificant anxietyrelated to changing circumstances in their lives may be confused about whether they are simply having a normal reaction to the change or are experiencing the beginning of an anxiety problem likegeneralized anxiety disorder(GAD). To complicate things further, GAD is often confused with other mental health issues likeadjustment disorder. Here's what you should know about the differences between generalized anxiety disorder and adjustment disorders. The major markers of GAD are significant, persistent, and uncontrollable anxiety and worry about a wide range of situations and things in life. Your anxiety will be pervasive and out of proportion to the circumstances—and can even be caused by nothing at all. You may feel that disaster is lurking around every corner. Your friends and family likely describe you as a ""worrier"" or ""nervous."" For instance, if you have GAD, you may insist your loved ones call you when they get home. If they don't call you, you might assume they've been in a car accident. If you go shopping or out to eat, you might worry about your credit card being stolen or someone following you. Some people may find you to be irrational about how worried you are each day. GAD can make you feel literally sick. You might experiencephysical symptoms of anxietysuch as: GAD can be extremely debilitating, limiting you from enjoying daily life and harming interpersonal relationships. ​ When people experience a major change in their life, they can respond in a variety of ways. Sometimes the stress of these changes causes a significant emotional or behavioral change that affects normal functioning. When this is the case, the person may have an adjustment disorder, which is a set of symptoms that develop within three months of the change and can involve significant anxiety. Adjustment disorder with anxiety is often an onset of worry, nervousness, anxiety, and irritability that is likely related to a specific event. Symptoms of adjustment disorder can include:1﻿ Adjustment disorder is often triggered by traumatic events, such as the death of a loved one or the loss of a job. It can significantly impact your ability to handle your daily responsibilities and in some cases, it can cause thoughts of suicide or self-harm. For people with GAD, there is often a long and consistent history of having anxiety and worry about a variety of things. People with adjustment disorder, on the other hand, only experience their symptoms in times of stress or change. People can, however, have both disorders, and GAD can be made worse by change and adjusting to new routines. People with adjustment disorder will often see a large reduction in their anxiety as they adapt to a life change, while anxiety is continual for those with GAD. Regardless if you have GAD or adjustment disorder, it is important to know that treatment is available and recovery is possible. Seeing a trained therapist can help you manage your symptoms and learncoping skillsto use in your everyday life. In some cases, a combination of therapy and anti-anxiety medications can help you regain control.

https://www.verywellmind.com/am-i-anxious-4045683,dynamic,Mental Health,Am I Anxious?,"Overlapping and distinguishing features of anxiety and depression Amy Morin, LCSW, is a psychotherapist and international bestselling author. Her books, including ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,"" have been translated into more than 40 languages. Her TEDx talk,  ""The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong,"" is one of the most viewed talks of all time. The terms “anxious” and “depressed” get thrown around a lot in casual conversation—and for good reason. Both arenormal emotionsto experience, routinely occurring in response to high-stakes or potentially dangerous situations (in the case of anxiety) or disappointing, upsetting circumstances (in the case of depression). The relationship between these emotions—and their associated clinical conditions, anxiety disorders and mood disorders—is complex and somewhat idiosyncratic.1 For one person, anxiety can lead to avoidance and isolation. Isolation can result in a lack of opportunity for pleasurable experiences, which then leads to low mood. For others, the emotions may flow in the opposite direction. Feeling down may zap someone of the energy to do things they typically enjoy, and attempts to re-engage with the world after being out of practice may result in nervousness. Understanding the distinctions between the two emotions (anxiety vs. depression) and characterizing the severity of the problem can help you to determine how to feel better. Anxiety and depression share a biological basis. Persistent states of anxiety or low mood like those experienced by people with clinical anxiety and mood disorders involve changes in neurotransmitter function. Lowserotoninlevels are thought to play a role in both, along with other brain chemicals such as dopamine and epinephrine.2 While the biological underpinnings of these problems are similar, anxiety and depression are experienced differently. In this way, the two states might be considered two sides of the same coin. Anxiety and depression can occur sequentially (one in reaction to the other), orthey can co-occur. When anxiety and mood problems reach the threshold for clinical diagnosis simultaneously, the specific diagnoses are consideredcomorbidconditions. Anxiety and depression have distinct psychological features. Their mental markers (symptoms or expressions of the condition) are different. People with anxiety may: Depending on the nature of the anxiety, these mental markers can vary. For example, someone withgeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD)may worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. A person withsocial anxiety disorder (SAD), on the other hand, is more apt to fear negative evaluation or rejection by others and to be apprehensive about meeting new people or other socially challenging situations. Obsessions are unrealistic thoughts or mental impulses (sometimes with a magical quality) that extend beyond everyday worries. They are the hallmark mental manifestation of anxiety in people with ​obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Simply put, people with anxiety are mentally preoccupied with worry to a degree that is disproportionate with actual risk or reality. People with depression may: Worry about the immediate or long-term future Have uncontrollable, racing thoughts Avoid situations that could cause anxiety Think about death due to perceived danger Feel hopeless about themselves, others, the world Believe it is not worth trying Feel worthless Think about death due to a persistent belief that life is not worth living In major depressive disorder (MDD), these types of thoughts are persistent most of the day and more days than not for weeks on end.3If a person vacillates between a very low and very high mood state, then a diagnosis ofbipolar disordermay apply. For any variant of amood disorder, the low mood state is likely to be characterized by the type of thinking described above. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat988for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. The physical symptoms of both anxiety or depression can be exhausting for the afflicted individual. The physical state of anxiety can be conceptualized overall as that ofheightened arousal.4﻿ Specific characteristics include: Depression is primarily characterized by changes in usual physical processes from baseline, such as:3﻿ It is not unusual to experience brief periods of low mood or anxiety, particularly in response to certain life stressors (for example, loss of a loved one, receiving a diagnosis of a physical illness, starting a new job or school, experiencing financial problems, etc.). To meet the diagnostic threshold of an anxiety disorder, however, symptoms must be persistent (often for several months) and impairing.5﻿ Mood disorders are diagnosed when the associated symptoms occur more often than not for at least a couple of weeks. To assess the severity of your symptoms: Even if you decide that your anxiety or mood problem is a low-grade issue for you, it is still worth working on. Consider how much it is interfering with your life, and in what ways, to determine what kinds of interventions might be helpful. If your symptoms are mild, tending to ebb and flow, or if you have had formal treatment previously and are concerned about relapse, self-help interventions can be a reasonable place to start. These approaches can include self-help books and phone apps that adapt evidence-based psychotherapies or offer a way to practice skills that target a symptom (such asmindfulness meditationfor anger or anxiety).​ If your symptoms are persistent, are impacting your relationships and ability to fulfill various responsibilities, or are clearly noticeable to others, then more formal treatment is worth considering. For depression and/or anxiety problems, there are several types of talk therapy. In structured psychotherapy, likecognitive behavioral therapy(CBT), the treatment approach for anxiety and depression can vary slightly.6﻿ For both issues, CBT will teach you how to work with unhelpful thought traps. And, for either problem, CBT is likely to ask that youdomore behaviorally. For anxiety, the goal is to minimize avoidant behavior and to help you disconfirm a feared consequence. For depression, the goal is to help you experience positive emotion, a surge in energy (even if briefly), or another type of pleasant interaction with the world. The theory is that activating behavior, even when—or especially when—your energy or mood is low, can result in some type of positive reward. Inpsychodynamic talk therapy, sessions for anxiety and depression may look more alike than different. You will be asked to speak freely about the past and the present in order to become aware of unconscious thoughts and conflicts underlying your symptoms. Do not despair if you think you are experiencing separate, co-occurring anxiety and mood symptoms. There is an overlap in effective psychotherapies for these problems. A group of medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been shown to be helpful for both anxiety and depression. Other medications that may be used depending on your symptoms include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and anti-anxiety medications. When seeking more formalized help for anxiety or depression, start by speaking with your primary care physician.5﻿ You can also research local referrals via national organizations including: Bear in mind that while effective treatment for anxiety or depression need not be a long-term commitment, it is likely to require regular, ongoing appointments at least in the short term (say, six to 12 months). Therefore, it is critical to find a professional you trust and with whom you feel comfortable speaking about your symptoms. It is equally important to make sure that you find a clinician that you can afford. Before making the commitment to ongoing care, you may want to meet with a couple of providers to get a feel for their therapeutic styles and their treatment recommendations. You can then use this information to determine which path forward feels best to you.

https://www.verywellmind.com/ways-to-defuse-anxious-thoughts-3863037,dynamic,Coping Strategies,Defusing Anxious Thoughts,"Recognize that your thoughts are thoughts and not truths Akeem Marsh, MD, is a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist who has dedicated his career to working with medically underserved communities. franckreporter / Getty Images A core component of anxiety—be it subclinical anxiety or anxiety that meets the threshold for ageneralized anxiety disorder(GAD) diagnosis—is anxious thinking that can, at times, feel uncontrollable.1 Psychotherapies for anxiety, likeacceptance and commitment therapy(ACT) andcognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT), emphasize becoming more aware of the thoughts as thoughts and not truths. However, the next step in ACT is to learn ways to be “less fused” with the thoughts, in other words, cognitive defusion.2 ACT and other psychotherapies help people address these thoughts in different ways. In psychodynamicpsychotherapy, the roots or underlying (sometimes called unconscious) reasons for anxiety are unearthed. In CBT, thoughts are actively challenged or tested by behavioral experiments (for example, doing something you are anxious about to experientially learn that the outcome will be OK).3 By changing the way you interact with your beliefs, you may begin to experience some relief. Here are five cognitive defusion exercises to try. Pick the one or two that most appeal to you, and try them repeatedly over the span of a few days. If it works, keep going with it; if it doesn’t, try another exercise on the list instead. The purpose of these exercises is not to change the frequency with which you experience anxious thoughts (though if that happens for you, fantastic!). Rather, defusion exercises are effective if they decrease your attachment to a particular belief or set of beliefs that are not currently serving you well.2﻿ If you or a loved one are struggling with anxiety, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

Rachel Goldman, PhD FTOS, is a licensed psychologist, clinical assistant professor, speaker, wellness expert specializing in eating behaviors, stress management, and health behavior change. Michela Buttignol for Verywell Mind / Stocksy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type ofpsychotherapeutic treatmentthat helps people learn how to identify and change the destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on their behavior and emotions.1 Cognitive behavioral therapy combinescognitive therapywithbehavior therapyby identifying maladaptive patterns of thinking, emotional responses, or behaviors and replacing them with more desirable or helpful patterns.2 Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on changing the automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen our emotional difficulties,depression, andanxiety. These spontaneous negative thoughts also have a detrimental influence on our mood. Through CBT, faulty thoughts are identified, challenged, and replaced with more objective, realistic thoughts. This video has been medically reviewed bySteven Gans, MD. CBT encompasses a range of techniques and approaches that address our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. These can range from structured psychotherapies to self-help practices. Some of the specific types of therapeutic approaches that involve cognitive behavioral therapy include: While each type of cognitive behavioral therapy takes a different approach, all work to address the underlying thought patterns that contribute to psychological distress. CBT is about more than identifying thought patterns. It uses a wide range of strategies to help people overcome these patterns. Here are just a few examples of techniques used in cognitive behavioral therapy. It is important to learn what thoughts, feelings, and situations are contributing to maladaptive, unhelpful, or harmful behaviors.5This process can be difficult, however, especially for people who struggle withintrospection. But taking the time to identify these thoughts can lead to self-discovery and provide insights that are essential to the treatment process. In cognitive behavioral therapy, people are often taught new skills that can be used in real-world situations. For example, someone with asubstance use disordermight practice new coping skills and rehearse ways to avoid or deal with social situations that could potentially trigger a relapse. Goal setting can be an important step in recovery from mental illness, helping you to make changes to improve your health and life. During cognitive behavioral therapy, a therapist can help you build andstrengthen your goal-setting skills. This might involve teaching you how to identify your goal or how to distinguish between short- and long-term goals. It may also include helping you setSMART goals(specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based), with a focus on the process as much as the end outcome. Learningproblem-solving skillsduring cognitive behavioral therapy can help you learn how to identify and solve problems that may arise from life stressors, both big and small. It can also help reduce the negative impact of psychological and physical illness. Problem-solving in CBT often involves five steps: Also known as diary work,self-monitoringis an important cognitive behavioral therapy technique. It involves tracking behaviors, symptoms, or experiences over time and sharing them with your therapist. Self-monitoring can provide your therapist with the information they need to give you the best treatment. For example, for people with eating disorders, self-monitoring may involve keeping track of eating habits, as well as any thoughts or feelings that went along with consuming a meal or snack.7 Additional cognitive behavioral therapy techniques may includejournaling,role-playing, engaging inrelaxation strategies, and usingmental distractions.8 Cognitive behavioral therapy can be used as a short-term treatment to help individuals learn to focus on present thoughts and beliefs.1 CBT is used to treat a wide range of conditions, including: In addition to mental health conditions, cognitive behavioral therapy has also been found to help people cope with: We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of thebest online therapy programsincluding Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. The underlying concept behind CBT is that thoughts and feelings play a fundamental role in behavior.1For example, a person who spends a lot of time thinking about plane crashes, runway accidents, and other air disasters may avoid air travel as a result. The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is to teach people that while they cannot control every aspect of the world around them, they can take control of how they interpret and deal with things in their environment. CBT is known for providing the following key benefits: One of the greatest benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy is that it helps clients developcoping skillsthat can be useful both now and in the future.1 CBT emerged during the 1960s and originated in the work of psychiatristAaron Beck, who noted that certain types of thinking contributed to emotional problems. Beck labeled these ""automatic negative thoughts"" and developed the process of cognitive therapy. Where earlier behavior therapies had focused almost exclusively on associations,reinforcements, and punishments to modify behavior, the cognitive approach addresses how thoughts and feelings affect behaviors. Today, cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the most well-studied forms of treatment. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of mental conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, insomnia,obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder,post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder. CBT is one of the most researched types of therapy, in part, because treatment is focused on very specific goals and results can be measured relatively easily. Verywell Mind'sCost of Therapy Survey, which sought to learn more about how Americans deal with the financial burdens associated with therapy, found that Americans overwhelmingly feel the benefits of therapy: There are several challenges that people may face when engaging in cognitive behavioral therapy. Here are a few to consider. Initially, some patients suggest that while they recognize that certain thoughts are not rational or healthy, simply becoming aware of these thoughts does not make it easy to alter them. Cognitive behavioral therapy doesn't focus on underlying, unconscious resistance to change as much as other approaches, such aspsychoanalytic psychotherapy.15Instead, it tends to be more structured, so it may not be suitable for people who may find structure difficult or who want to more freely explore their past and their emotions. For cognitive behavioral therapy to be effective, you must be ready and willing to spend time and effort analyzing your thoughts and feelings. This self-analysis can be difficult, but it is a great way to learn more about how your internal states impact your outward behavior. In most cases, CBT is a gradual process that helps you take incremental steps towardbehavior change. For example, someone with social anxiety might start by simply imagining anxiety-provoking social situations. Next, they may practice conversations with friends, family, and acquaintances. By progressively working toward a larger goal, the process seems less daunting and the goals easier to achieve. There is no magic therapy bullet - all therapy, including CBT, takes time and effort. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be an effective treatment choice for a range of psychological issues. If you or someone you love might benefit from this form of therapy, consider the following steps: If you're new to cognitive behavioral therapy, you may have uncertainties or fears of what to expect. In many ways, the first session begins much like your first appointment with any new healthcare provider. During the first session, you'll likely spend some time filling out paperwork such as HIPAA forms (privacy forms), insurance information, medical history, current medications, and a therapist-patient service agreement. If you're participating in online therapy, you'll likely fill out these forms online. Also be prepared to answer questionsabout what brought you to therapy, yoursymptoms, and your history—including your childhood, education, career, relationships (family, romantic, friends), and current living situation. Once the therapist has a better idea of who you are, the challenges you face, and your goals for cognitive behavioral therapy, they can help you increase your awareness of the thoughts and beliefs you have that are unhelpful or unrealistic. Next, strategies are implemented to help you develop healthier thoughts and behavior patterns. During later sessions, you will discuss how your strategies are working and change the ones that aren't. Your therapist may also suggest cognitive behavioral therapy techniques you can do yourself between sessions, such as journaling to identify negative thoughts or practicing new skills toovercome your anxiety. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat988for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.

https://www.verywellmind.com/physical-symptoms-of-anxiety-1393151,dynamic,Physical Symptoms,Physical Signs of Anxiety,"Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Tom Merton/OJO Images/Getty Images Anxiety is about more than just feeling worried or nervous—it is often accompanied by a number of unpleasant and distressing physical symptoms as well. There are a number of different types of disorders that are linked to such physical manifestation of anxiety, includinggeneralized anxiety disorder(GAD),social anxiety disorder(SAD),panic disorder, andspecific phobias. Some of the primary physical symptoms of anxiety can include: The muscle tension associated withnormal anxietymight involve a brief tensing of the back and neck that relaxes when a threat passes.1The muscle tension described by people with anxiety, on the other hand, may include unrelenting aches and pains in overly active shoulder, back,neck, and jaw muscles. The tension might also include restless fidgeting of tense legs orgrinding of the teeth. These manifestations of muscle tension don't subside in the absence of a threat. Instead, they persist until specific relaxation or mindfulness skills are employed, ormedications that promote relaxationare taken. The gut also holds and expresses anxiety. This can take the form of non-specific unsettling of the stomach, outright nausea, constipation, or diarrhea. Digestive problems can have a particularly negative impact on day-to-day functioning. Beyond being uncomfortable and disruptive in their own right, these symptoms may perpetuate worries about the presence of a medical illness. The psychological distress associated with anxiety involves persistent general worry or fears of specific situations.2Thoughts may race down a spiral of anticipation and fear about one topic or may bounce incessantly from one issue or scenario to the next. This psychological experience can result, literally, in an aching head and dizziness. The edginess associated with anxiety can manifest behaviorally as irritability or physically as trembling and shaking. The fidgeting or restlessness may be more obvious to observers than to the person experiencing it in some cases. Chronic worry, simply put, is exhausting, so it's common for people with anxiety to be fatigued. But, sometimes, the worry or other physical symptoms of anxiety make it difficult either to fall or stay asleep. In the short term, this can take a toll on other aspects of physical and psychological well-being. For people experiencing even mild sleep disruptions, anxiety treatment is likely to involve changes to the bedtime routine. Along with increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, sweating, and/or dizziness, shortness of breath can occur.1Shortness of breath as an anxiety symptom is more likely to occur as part of apanic attack. Hosted by Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode ofThe Verywell Mind Podcastshares how to recognize and ease anxiety, featuring neuroscientist Dr. Jud Brewer. Follow Now:Apple Podcasts/Spotify/Google Podcasts Anxiety brings about psychological and physical symptoms—both of which can be overwhelming. Anticipating future threats, the body gears up for afight-or-flight moment. The brain activates the heart, lungs, and muscles so you'll be ready to engage or flee. With that, the heart beats faster, you begin to sweat, and your muscles tense, among other involuntary responses. Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent and intense physical symptoms. Considering these reactions is especially important when diagnosing anxiety disorders.3 In fact, to meet theformal criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), for example, anxiety must be associated with multiplephysical symptoms. In children, the presence of even one of these symptoms is sufficient for a diagnosis to be made. While anxiety can lead to a number of physical symptoms, there are also medical conditions that can sometimes feel like anxiety. Some medical conditions that can cause anxiety-like symptoms including heart problems, asthma, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and neurological conditions. A doctor can evaluate your symptoms and rule out anyunderlying medical causes. Anxiety can also take a toll on physical and mental health, particularly when it is prolonged. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) suggests that people who have anxiety are at an increased risk for a number of different health problems. Research has also found that having more anxiety symptoms is connected to a higher risk of developing: Anxiety can also contribute to other problems including chronic pain, digestive problems, depression, social issues, and substance use.6 Treatments for anxiety can vary depending on the specific condition you have as well as the nature and severity of your symptoms. In most cases, treatment for the emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms of anxiety involves medication, therapy, or a combination of the two.3 Medication can be helpful for addressing the physical symptoms of anxiety.Benzodiazepineshave a sedative effect and can provide fast-acting relief for the physical effects of anxiety. However, these medications can also be habit-forming, which is why they are often prescribed for short-term relief. Other medications may also be prescribed including antidepressants and beta-blockers.3 Different types of talk therapy can also be helpful for addressing symptoms of anxiety. Physical symptoms are only considered a manifestation of anxiety if they're not better explained by the presence of a medical condition. Thus, careful evaluation by both a medical professional and a mental health provider is the most assured way to distinguish their cause. Anxiety disorders are quite common, but often go undiagnosed and untreated. Because women tend to experience symptoms more often than men, experts now recommend that all women and girls aged 13 and older be screened for anxiety during routine preventative exams.9﻿ Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms since anxiety can worsen over time. Early intervention can improve your daily functioning and mental well-being. The physical complaints that are symptomatic of an anxiety problem are no less uncomfortable than those ascribed to a medical condition. Fortunately, as you undergo treatment for anxiety, the symptoms and your tools to cope with them will improve. If you or a loved one are struggling with anxiety, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. In addition to professional treatment, self-help strategies can also be beneficial for relieving physical symptoms of stress. Relaxation strategies such as deep breathing, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness, meditation, and visualization can be effective. Getting regular physical exercise has also been shown to be effective in combatting anxiety.10 Physical symptoms of anxiety can be short-lived in some cases, but they can also be longer-lasting depending on the nature of the symptoms. People who have anxiety conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder often have symptoms that happen on most days for six months or longer.11For other people, symptoms may only emerge in certain situations or when exposed to certain objects. In some cases, physical symptoms of anxiety can become so severe that a person experiences a panic attack. Symptoms of a panic attack include chest pain, difficulty breathing, choking sensations, racing heartbeat, hot flashes, hyperventilation, numbness, feelings of detachment, and a sense ofimpending death.11 Anxiety can become severe enough that it interferes with a person's ability to function in their daily life and creates significant distress. This may be a sign that a person has an anxiety disorder. Panic attacks can be severe enough that they are sometimes mistaken for heart attacks and lead to hospitalization.12People may engage in avoidance behaviors that can be life-limiting and make it difficult to do everyday tasks.

https://www.verywellmind.com/hyperventilation-in-anxiety-6740162,dynamic,Physical Symptoms,Hyperventilation and Anxiety,"Arlin Cuncic, MA, is the author of The Anxiety Workbook and founder of the website About Social Anxiety. She has a Master's degree in clinical psychology. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Moyo Studio / Getty Images Hyperventilation is rapid breathing that usually occurs as a result of anxiety or panic (also called over-breathing).1This leads to low levels of carbon dioxide in your blood which causes a number of symptoms. Hyperventilation in anxiety can be a tricky thing to understand. On one hand, it can feel like you're suffocating or not getting enough air. On the other hand, hyperventilation can also cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. The good news is that hyperventilation caused by anxiety is completely treatable. In most cases, all you need to do is slow down your breathing and make sure you're takingdeep breathsfrom your diaphragm (stomach breathing). If you're having trouble with hyperventilation related to anxiety, please seekprofessional help. A therapist can assist you in learning how to control your breathing and manage your anxiety. Anxiety can cause hyperventilation in a few different ways. First, anxiety itself can be a trigger for hyperventilation.2This is because when we feel anxious, our bodies go into ""fight-or-flight"" mode. This causes a number of physical changes, including an increase in heart rate and breathing rate. Another way that anxiety can be related to hyperventilation is indirectly. Anxiety is associated with other conditions that can lead to hyperventilation such asGERD(gastroesophageal reflux disease) or asthma.34 The symptoms of hyperventilation vary from person to person, but they can generally be divided into two categories: physical and psychological.1 The treatment for hyperventilation depends on the underlying cause. If anxiety is the cause, then treating the anxiety will usually help to resolve the hyperventilation. This may involve medication, therapy, or both. If another condition is causing hyperventilation (such as GERD or asthma), then treating that condition will usually help to resolve the hyperventilation. In some cases, it may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperventilation directly.1This can be done through a variety of different techniques, including: If you're experiencing symptoms of hyperventilation, it's important to see a healthcare provider to rule out any other potential medical causes. Once a diagnosis of hyperventilation is made, treatment can begin. With treatment, most people are able to resolve their symptoms and live normal, healthy lives. Here are some ways you can prevent hyperventilation due to anxiety: Once you know what's causing your anxiety, there are a number of different treatment options available. Treatment for anxiety can includemedication,therapy, or both. If you're not sure what type of treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you to figure out the best course of treatment for your individual needs. With treatment, most people are able to reduce their anxiety and stop hyperventilating. If you're struggling to stop hyperventilating, don't give up. Talk to your healthcare provider about other treatment options or consider seeking out asupport group. There are many resources available to help you deal with anxiety and hyperventilation. You don't have to go through this alone. Although it can be scary, hyperventilation is a common symptom of anxiety. With treatment, most people are able to reduce their stress and stop hyperventilating. The best thing you can do if you're struggling with hyperventilation is to talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you identify the cause of your hyperventilation and recommend the appropriate treatment to help get it under control. Hyperventilation is a common symptom of anxiety, but it's not necessarily part of anxiety. Hyperventilation can be related to a number of different things, including GERD3and asthma.4If you're experiencing hyperventilation, it's important to see a healthcare provider to rule out any other potential causes. Hyperventilation from anxiety typically lasts 20 to 30 minutes. In some cases, people may experience recurrent episodes of hyperventilation which may be diagnosed as hyperventilation syndrome (HVS).5However, with treatment, most people are able to reduce their anxiety and stop hyperventilating. If you think you are hyperventilating, the main goal is to get more carbon dioxide into your blood. To do this, you can purse your lips (as if you're blowing out a candle) and breathe out. You can alsobreathethrough your abdomen and tryprogressive muscle relaxation. If you're still feeling anxious or short of breath, call your healthcare provider. They can give you further instructions on what to do. If your hyperventilation was caused by anxiety or panic, you'll need to also schedule an appointment with amental health professional.

Armeen Poor, MD, is a board-certified pulmonologist and intensivist. He specializes in pulmonary health, critical care, and sleep medicine. Oleg Breslavtsev / Getty Images Sleep anxiety involves fear or worries about being able to fall or stay asleep. Such worry can then interfere with a person's ability to get adequate rest. Sleep anxiety is complex, and people may experience it in various ways. It can make falling asleep harder or make staying asleep more challenging. It can also lead to feelings of anxiety about whether you'll be able to get the sleep you need. While people are aware of the importance of sleep, they are also conscious of the fact that they often don't get the recommended amount of rest. For some, just the thought of climbing into bed each night can be anxiety-provoking. Where many people nod off quickly and easily, others find themselves tossing and turning as thoughts race through their minds and the pressure builds to catch a few elusive Zzzzs as the hours tick past. Research suggests that among people with insomnia, around 24% to 36% have some type of anxiety disorder, includinggeneralized anxiety disorder(GAD),panic disorder, or anxiety associated withpost-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD).1 This article explores the signs of sleep anxiety and the impact it can have on your life and health. It also discusses the causes and potential treatments for sleep anxiety. While some may find going to sleep an easy and natural process, those with sleep anxiety often see it with fear and apprehension. Symptoms that people with sleep anxiety often experience include: Anxiety can affect health and functioning in a variety of ways, including interfering with sleep. Unfortunately, sleep deprivation can then worsen symptoms of anxiety. Symptoms include worrying about sleep and feeling stressed or anxious about the prospect of trying to fall asleep. If you are struggling with persistent feelings of anxiety and difficulty sleeping, it is important to discuss your symptoms with your doctor.Anxietycan be serious and can grow worse over time.2Sleep deprivation can also take a significant toll on your mind and body. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will ask questions about the symptoms you have been experiencing. Be open and honest about your struggles with sleep and the effect it is having on your ability to function in your daily life. Your doctor will also want to know more about how long your symptoms have occurred, your medical history, and any other medications or supplements you are currently taking. Certain medications or supplements may contribute to anxiety symptoms or sleep disturbances. Your doctor may also perform a physical exam and conduct lab tests to rule out any medical conditions that might be causing your symptoms. Your doctor may diagnose you with insomnia, an anxiety disorder, or both. However, other factors or conditions can also play a role. The specific treatment your doctor recommends will depend on your diagnosis. In many cases, sleep anxiety represents a form of performance anxiety. Performance anxiety is atype of anxietyfocused on a person's ability to perform a certain task. While we often associate this type of anxiety with worries about public speaking, athletic performance, or test-taking, it can also emerge when you’re anxious about being able to do what seems to come so naturally to other people. In the case of sleep anxiety, this fear centers on your ability to ""perform"" sleep. When you find it difficult to fall asleep, it means you also have more time to focus on your fears and worries. As you lie awake, free from the usual daytime distractions, your mind may drift towardruminationand worry, including fretting over the fact that you’renotsleeping. Unfortunately, these concerns then make it even more difficult to drift off. This nightly battle can then lead to what is known asanticipatory anxiety, or feeling anxious about things that haven’t happened yet. You might find yourself dreading going to bed each night. Over time, this not only contributes to sleep deprivation but can also play a part in the development of worsening anxiety. Research has found that people who tend to sleep poorly also tend to experience more frequent and longer-lastingnegative thoughts.3 Sleep anxiety is sometimes connected to different types of mental health conditions. People who experience these conditions are sometimes more likely to struggle with sleep, which can increase their risk of developing sleep anxiety. Certain conditions can increase the risk for sleep anxiety, including generalized anxiety, insomnia, panic disorder, PTSD, and other sleep disorders. While sleep anxiety can be understandably upsetting and disruptive, there are effective treatments that can help. The right approach for you depends on what is causing your symptoms, but will often involve interventions aimed at reducing anxiety and insomnia. Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for anxiety.Cognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT) andexposure therapyare two types that can be particularly effective. However, certain medications may also be prescribed to help manage both acute and long-term anxiety. Benzodiazepines are sometimes prescribed to manage immediate symptoms of anxiety, while antidepressants, such asselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs), can be a longer-term treatment. In addition to addressing underlying conditions that may contribute to anxiety, treatments for insomnia often focus on psychotherapy and lifestyle modifications.Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia(CBT-I) focuses on adjusting thoughts to promote sleep, practicing relaxation strategies, and using other strategies to improve sleep. Medications are sometimes prescribed to treat insomnia and may include prescription sleeping pills, OTC sleeping pills,melatonin, and natural remedies. While these medications can help people get more sleep in the short term, they can have side effects and don't address the underlying factors that are contributing to sleep anxiety. While sleep anxiety is distressing, making certain lifestyle changes and utilizing effective sleep strategies can help you feel less anxious and better rested. Tweaking your sleep habits can significantly improve sleep, which may help you to feel less anxious about falling and staying asleep. Helpful strategies include: Need a breather? Take this free2-minute meditation to help you fall asleep—or choose from ourguided meditation libraryto find another one that will help you feel your best. Regular exercise can help improve sleep and combat feelings of anxiety. One study found exercise can help improve sleep quality.7 Research has also shown that exercise can be helpful in reducing symptoms of anxiety. Not only can it relieve symptoms of anxiety, but it may also be protective against future anxiety.8 Relaxation techniques can help combat stress and take some of the pressure off you might be putting on yourself each night. Strategies that can be helpful include: Sleep and anxiety have a bidirectional relationship. Anxiety can make it difficult to sleep, but poor sleep can also lead to increased feelings of anxiety. When you find yourself getting anxious and stressed, remember that it may take time to get your sleep back on track. Celebrate the small victories, focus on establishing healthy sleep habits, and turn to effective relaxation techniques when you find yourself struggling.

She is a health writer and researcher passionate about the mind-body connection, and holds a Master's degree in psychology. Akeem Marsh, MD, is a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist who has dedicated his career to working with medically underserved communities. B2M Productions / Getty Images Sleep disturbances are extremely common throughout the population. Many individuals have troublesleepingat night, which impacts their quality of life and psychological well-being tremendously.1 People find it difficult to fall asleep and remain asleep throughout the night. Some people also do not always prioritize sleep, especially when stressed by the demands of work and family.2Adults often find themselves sleeping late and awakening early, not receiving the suggested 7 to 8 hours of sleep. This can be very destructive to overall well-being.1 One study explained that “sleep disturbances encompass various potentially overlapping symptoms and disorders includinginsomnia,  hypersomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, circadian rhythm disturbances, and extrinsic sleep disorders (related to insufficient sleep and sleep hygiene)”.1 Good sleep hygieneis associated with positive well-being. It is restorative because it helps the body to regenerate after a full day. It also allows an individual to remain healthy and establish a balanced mood. Sleep is associated with neurophysiological activity and helps maintain a healthy metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory system.3This aids in protecting the body from chronic conditions like diabetes andhigh blood pressure. Poor sleep can also affectcognitiveabilities and everyday functioning. Anxietymay have a major impact on sleep quality. Those who are prone to experiencing severe anxiety might find it difficult to sleep at night.  Difficulties sleeping are actually correlated with anxiety symptoms.1 Sleep is often a symptom of certain anxiety disorders. It is actually a diagnostic symptom for disorders likegeneralized anxiety disorder(GAD) andpost-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD).4 There is comorbidity with sleep disorders, like insomnia, and anxiety disorders. There is no clear understanding if one condition triggers the other. Lack of sleep itself can, however, cause anxiety to set in, and there is a great likelihood of anxiety affecting sleep hygiene. Researchers4believe both anxiety and sleep difficulties contribute to each other, producing a cycle ofsleep deprivationand anxiety symptoms. Sleep dysfunction and anxietyboth have negative impacts onmentaland physical health. They both may cause fatigue and stress while impacting psychological well-being, cognition as well as the immune and central nervous systems. There is also a link between sleep dysfunctions and chronic illnesses. A population survey exploring the relationship between anxiety disorders and sleep found that 24% to 36% of those with an anxiety disorder had symptoms of insomnia, and 27% to 42% reported symptoms of hypersomnia.4 The following are interventions for helping develop better sleep hygiene when prone to experiencing symptoms of anxiety: Let's take a look at some activities you can do before you sleep that can help you get better rest: Need a breather? Take this free2-minute meditation to help you fall asleep—or choose from ourguided meditation libraryto find another one that will help you feel your best. Below are some dietary tips you can employ that may help promote better sleep hygiene. Refrain From Eating Three Hours Before Bedtime It takes the body time to digest food after eating, which causes the metabolism to operate at night when the body is attempting to rest.8 If you feel a need to eat before bed make sure it is something light that wouldn’t delay sleep. For example, consuming anything withcaffeinein it will make it more difficult to fall asleep. Try Supplements That Promote Relaxation Dietary supplements likemagnesium,melatonin, andashwagandha9are sometimes used to help calm the mind and body and settle the nerves. Melatonin is one of the most popular dietary supplements used to help with sleep. In a review of multiple studies, researchers found melatonin to benefit the sleep quality of those with sleeping disorders.10 Melatonin helped individuals to fall asleep quicker and remain asleep longer.10Melatonin was not as effective as certain sleep medications, but some individuals would rather try a supplement for sleep before resorting to sleeping medication that may have side effects. Unfortunately, supplements like melatonin andashwagandhamay not benefit every person and could cause a reverse effect that negatively impacts sleep, anxiety, and depression.11 Try Herbal Tea Herbal tea can help with relaxation and stress relief. While reviewing a variety of studies regarding the health benefits of herbal teas, researchers found that chamomile and lavender improve sleep quality.12 Chamomile is one of the most popular teas that people drink before bedtime to help them fall asleep. An experimental study examining the effect of chamomile tea on sleep quality in women withpostpartum depression, found this tea to improve both sleep and depression symptoms.13 Ensuring that your sleeping environment is peaceful can help promote a better night's sleep. Here are some ways you can create a healthy sleep environment: If you're looking to get your body and mind relaxed before bed, here are some techniques you can try: If you are someone who finds it difficult to get quality sleep due to anxiety, consider trying the interventions mentioned in this article. It may be best to consult your physician before including a new dietary supplement in your daily routine. Not every supplement works the same for everyone so there is a possibility that certain supplements or medications can have a negative effect on anxiety and make it more difficult to sleep. Your physician or amental health professionalcan also help in deciding whether sleep or anxiety medication is a good option for you.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Maskot / Getty Images TheNational Institute of Mental Health(NAMH) estimates that 31% of U.S. adults may experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. If we allow our anxiety to spiral without adequately dealing with it, our symptoms can become way worse. In addition, it can impact our relationships with our partners, family, and friends and interfere with our work. To help address anxiety, try one or more of the following self-soothing techniques. “Excessive worryis a symptom of anxiety. The worry jar exercise helps to move on from worrying by acknowledging your thoughts and then giving distance to them,” explainsKatelyn Anderson, a licensed independent clinical social worker. Close your eyes and envision the following: This exercise can be guided imagery or with a pen, paper, and a recycled jar. Physically placing the closed jar of worries aside and out of the way is symbolic of controlling your response to them and letting them go. Positive affirmationsare short, powerful statements that help you to challenge your negative thoughts. Affirmations boost our self-confidence and help us to focus on the positives versus dwelling on the negatives. It takes practice, but over time you will notice a shift. Start by choosing an affirmation you’d like to focus on, such as: Repeat your affirmation slowly five to 10 times, allowing yourself to truly feel and absorb the message. Breathe deeply between each repetition to further connect to your body during the moment. “Journaling can help you process your thoughts and feelings, as well as allow you to see them from a new point of view,” explains Anderson. “Whether you're jotting down a to-do list for the next day or writing a lengthy reflection, journaling helps us slow down, calm down, and put challenges into perspective.” There are different ways to format a journal entry. Try experimenting with the following, and allow yourself to change your journaling approach as necessary to help maintain motivation. Need a breather? Take this free2-minute meditation for instant calm—or choose from ourguided meditation libraryto find another one that will help you feel your best. Thisself-soothingtechnique is especially effective in the moment when you feel your stress and anxiety rising or spiraling. Here are a few ways you canphysically ground yourself: Under anxiety, our breathing tends to become quick and shallow, depriving our body of essential oxygen. This can create a cyclical effect, where we feel anxious, take shallow breaths, get more anxious, and then breathe even more poorly. Breathing exercisesgive us control over our breath in the moment, which can help us feel better physically and mentally. Box breathing is a simple breathing exercise you can do at any time. It gets its name because it involves four equal parts: an exhale while counting to four, holding lungs empty for four counts, inhaling for four counts, holding air for four counts, then exhaling again before repeating. If you're experiencing ongoing anxiety, you're not alone. The above coping strategies can help curb excessive worry, but if you find yourself unable to manage your anxiety, then we recommend seeking help from a therapist. Together, you'll be able to identify some of your common anxiety triggers, come up with a treatment plan, and develop healthy pathways to handle ongoing anxiety.

https://www.verywellmind.com/can-anxiety-really-kill-you-5204411,dynamic,Mental Health,Can Anxiety Kill You?,"Brittany is a health and lifestyle writer and former staffer at TODAY on NBC and CBS News. She's also contributed to dozens of magazines. Akeem Marsh, MD, is a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist who has dedicated his career to working with medically underserved communities. Maskot / Getty Images Anxiety can be incredibly distressing. Sometimes, such as when you are having apanic attack, it might even feel like death is imminent. After such episodes, you might find yourself wondering, can anxiety kill you? The good news is that while anxiety is stressful and sometimes scary, it won't kill you. It's the effects of long-term, untreated anxiety that put your life at risk. Anxiety can increase your blood pressure, worsen cardiovascular health, weaken your immune system, and increase the risk of suicide. Everyone experiences anxiety, but if it gets to the point where you'restruggling with its side effects, it may be time to get some help. While anxiety itself will not kill you, it has been linked to heart disease, as well as several other symptoms that can pose severe threats to your health. Below, we've outlined exactly what anxiety is, as well as its physical symptoms and long-term impacts. We also go over panic attacks and anxiety disorders so that you can better understand what causes them. Finally, we talk about how to support someone in your life who has severe anxiety and how to get help if you're living with anxiety. The American Psychiatric Association defines anxiety as ""an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts, and physical changes like increased blood pressure.""1 That said, anxiety can manifest itself differently for everyone, but it often feels like a constant, nagging worry that just won't go away. While sometimes worrying can be warranted (in some cases it may be your brain's way of protecting you from real danger), anxiety leans more to unfounded worries that won't go away. Things to pay attention to if you thinkyou're experiencing an abnormal amount of anxietyare the length of time that your feelings persist, the intensity of the feelings of nerves, and the inability to focus on an exact cause.2 Anxiety may be taking place in your mind, but the side effects can certainly manifest in a physical way. While there are lots of physical side effects that can pop up, these are the most common. General anxiety may include one or more of these symptoms,however, panic attacks often include many of them at once:3 Researchers at theAnxiety Disorders Programat Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center believe that4there are ties between long-term anxiety and the development of heart disease. Perhaps what's most interesting about this research is that it determined that anxiety can not only lead to a higher risk of developing heart disease, but it can also act as an obstacle for those recovering from heart disease. One of the reasons why this is thought to impact the heart4is that it interferes with lots of things, like regular exercise and eating well, that can stave off the occurrence of heart disease. In addition to making ithard to stick to schedulesor do daily tasks, anxiety can lead to rapid heart rate, increased blood pressure, and decreased heart rate variability—all of which put you at a higher risk for developing heart disease. Research has also shown that anxiety canactually damage the brainand increase the risk of developing dementia later in life. It can also put people at a higher risk of developing depression.5This is because it was found to lead to structural degeneration of the prefrontal cortex andhippocampus. Panic attacks can definitely make people think that they're dying, and this is primarily because they share so many symptoms in common with heart attacks. Panic attack and heart attack victims both typically experience sudden chest pains, heavy heart palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, and a number of other symptoms. The ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" (DSM-5-TR) defines panic attacks as ""asudden sense of fear and dread.""6 That said, to be classified as a panic attack, this sudden sense of fear and dread must be accompanied by at least four other mental, emotional, and physical symptoms. These symptoms can include any of the general symptoms of anxiety listed earlier if they occur in a sudden manner. It's also important to note that there are two main types of panic attacks: An example of an expected panic attack would be if a person with aknown phobia(think small spaces or spiders) knows that they're going to be exposed to that fear. Unexpected panic attacks come out of nowhere and aren't a result of any mental or external triggers.6 While terrifying, panic attacks are not fatal. The symptoms you experience during a panic attack may make it feel that you are dying and may even be mistaken for a life-threatening condition such as a stroke or heart attack. Panic attacks are usually brief, lasting around five to 20 minutes. If your symptoms don't resolve within this time, contact your doctor to rule out a more serious medical condition. Treatment for anxiety typically focuses on the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This type of therapy involves identifying negative thought patterns that play a role in causing anxiety and then replacing those thoughts with more positive ones.

Jose Luis Pelaez Inc. / Getty Images Relationship anxiety refers to feelings of doubt, insecurity, nonstop worry, and a need for constant reassurance that sometimes occurs during a relationship. Such anxiety may have roots in early childhood attachments and is often a sign of an insecure attachment style. Picture this: it's the start of what could be a perfect relationship. The conversation is fantastic, communication is loud and clear both ways, and everything seems set for a happily ever after—except for one or two doubts you can't seem to shake off. 'What do they even see in me?', 'Will they get bored?' 'How long untilthis onefalls apart?' In some cases, these questions linger on even after 'I love yous' have been exchanged in the relationship. If you've ever found yourself asking these questions, there is a chance that you may be familiar withrelationship anxiety. When a person starts to feel anxious about life with a current or prospective partner, it’s an understandable worry—this is a big part of their lives. However, in certain cases, this worry becomes so crippling, it can prevent the relationship from flourishing, or even taking off, to begin with. We'll be examining the causes of relationship anxiety, what to look out for, and the appropriate ways to navigate this feeling. When worries start to creep in and become a familiar feature of a budding or current relationship, you might be dealing with relationship anxiety. Let's take a look at some common causes. When you find that you are constantly questioning the security of your relationship or the depth of feelings your partner has for you, this can sometimes be traced back to the relationship you shared with your parents or other caregivers when growing up. In cases where their parents or guardians consistently show a child love and affection, this can form asecure attachment styleto these relationships. However, where the child is shown love and care on some occasions, but cruelty and abandonment on others, they may form an anxious attachment with the people they love and trust. This can cause the child to cling to these beloved figures for attention. The child may also require the constant assurance of their love—traits that may appear in later years within romantic relationships. People with anxious attachment styles often question their worth and are typically on guard, watching for the first signs that their partners may be losing interest in them. In addition, this attachment places them in a state of worry over losing their significant others.1 Imagine a scenario where you get stung by a bee. Hearing a buzzing anytime after that may produce a certain amount of fear that causes you to be wary of getting stung again. The same can sometimes occur with relationships. If a person has experienced a relationship where their self-worth, value, attractiveness, etc., was called into question, this can trigger anxiety that partnering with another person will produce the same effects. If this happens, a previously hurt person may remain on edge, constantly questioning the stability of the relationship and the feelings involved in it. Living with a poor estimation of your self-worth and value can strongly affect your quality of life.2 In cases where a person struggles with lowself-esteem, this can raise constant doubt about the authenticity of a partner's feelings for them or whether they are deserving of their partner's love. It may also encourage assumptions ofunfaithfulnessand other questions that can put the future of the relationship in jeopardy. In some cases, experiencing worry about your partner's affection or the future of your relationship may be tied to the fact that honest conversations about shared feelings, the state of the relationship, or plans together are lacking with your partner. Failing to speak on these matters can leave a vacuum in the relationship, encouraging feelings of anxiety. Here are some signs that anxiety may be manifesting itself in your relationship: In other cases, relationship anxiety may take the form of deliberately sabotaging things with your partner. This can be seen where slight issues are blown out of proportion or where traps are laid for your partner to test fidelity. It may also appear in instances where you purposely stay aloof and guarded with your partner, all to steel yourself against hurt and pre-empt difficulties. Before placing a magnifying glass on the way you act within your relationship, it's important to note that not every demonstration of worry is a sign of relationship anxiety. In fact, taking stock of what is working, changes in communication, and feelings shared within the relationship is healthy and encouraged. However, when the energy you expend in keeping tabs on your partner and their attitude within the relationship constantly leaves you feeling on edge, that could be problematic. Constantly worrying about the relationship can also affect the quality of love and intimacy you enjoy. In some cases, experiencing persistent feelings of anxiety within the relationship can produce the most feared result—an end to the union. If you realize that you frequently experience relationship anxiety, this can negatively affect your well-being and the chances of experiencing a future with your partner. However, you should know that there are steps you can take to improve the quality of your life and your relationship to avoid the harmful effects of anxiety. Fortunately, if you're having relationship anxiety, there are ways to help cope with—or even stop—those feelings. Here are a few options to consider. To get ahead of anxiety, it's important to have honest conversations with your partner about your worries, expectations, or dreams for the future. Share doubts you may have and talk through challenges. This will always beat making up scenarios where only the worst outcomes are imagined. By speaking clearly with your partner, uncertainties that can encourage anxiety are avoided, leaving room for a healthy appreciation of the relationship. When you catch your mind starting to wonder about the fate of your relationship in years to come, it is always advisable to nip that in the bud and enjoy the present moment. Considering whether or not your partner will even be in your life in five years, or if they'll still find you desirable in months to come, only takes away from cherishing your current joy. Instead, it saddles you with worry over future events that may not even occur. To manage your anxieties, treasure your current reality, and savor the happiness of being with a person you have chosen and who has also chosen to be with you at the moment. It may sound counterproductive to embrace your anxieties while attempting to get over them, but this is one of the most effective ways to get your emotions under control. Are you anxious because of a past failed relationship? Perhaps you worry about not being good enough for love because you struggle with how you view yourself. Questioning the reasons for your anxiety in relationships can help you recognize these issues and tackle them clearly. In certain situations, getting professional help to manage your anxiety may be the best option for getting it under control. Through therapy, you can receive the proper guidance to change negative and dysfunctional thoughts about yourself, your self-worth, and your attitude towards your partner. Therapy can also teach appropriate methods to manage your anxiety to prevent lasting damage to the relationship. When you care very deeply about something, it's understandable to worry about it from time to time—relationships are no different. However, while concerns about your partner and their feelings towards you are valid, this can quickly become unhealthy and injurious to your personal health. This is especially seen where you constantly obsess about who your partner is speaking with, whether the relationship will stand the test of time, and other signs of relationship anxiety. Thankfully, there are ways to get anxiety in a relationship under control, and one of the most potent forms is simply communicating worries, challenges, hopes, etc., truthfully with your partner. You may also bravely face the reasons you experience relationship fears. However, if additional help is required to get things under control, therapy can help change negative thinking and ideas of self-worth.3 Simpson JA, Rholes WS.Adult attachment, stress, and romantic relationships.Curr Opin Psychol. 2017;13:19-24. doi:10.1016/j.copsyc.2016.04.006 Nguyen DT, Wright EP, Dedding C, Pham TT, Bunders J.Low self-esteem and its association with anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation in vietnamese secondary school students: A cross-sectional study.Front Psychiatry. 2019;10:698. doi:10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00698 Kertz SJ, Koran J, Stevens KT, Björgvinsson T.Repetitive negative thinking predicts depression and anxiety symptom improvement during brief cognitive behavioral therapy.Behaviour Research and Therapy. 2015;68:54-63. doi:10.1016/j.brat.2015.03.006 ByElizabeth PlumptreElizabeth is a freelance health and wellness writer.

Her work spans various health-related topics, including mental health, fitness, nutrition, and wellness. Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Maskot / Getty Images One symptom of ananxiety disorderis feeling as if you are paralyzed with anxiety. This paralyzing anxiety may leave you feeling unable to move, speak, and think. Your arms and legs may feel heavy and immobile, you may be unable to form words, and you may struggle to process what is happening around you. Anxiety can paralyze you both physically and emotionally, explainsPaula Zimbrean, MD, a psychiatrist at Yale Medicine. Zimbrean describes what emotional and physical paralysis can feel like and how they can impact your life. While the experience can differ somewhat from one person to the next, the physical symptoms you experience when you feel paralyzed with anxiety can be particularly disconcerting. Anxiety can cause multiple physical symptoms, and one of them is the sensation of being unable to move physically, to the extent where you feel like you cannot walk or move your arms and legs. You may experience physically paralyzing anxiety in the wake of a clear stressor, a major life change, a disaster, or atraumatic event. However, it can sometimes occur without you being aware of the cause. Being paralyzed with anxiety can have significant effects on your ability to function normally in different areas of your everyday life. The immediate impact of physically paralyzing anxiety is the inability to perform certain everyday tasks,work-related assignments, or social activities. It can also cause you to believe that something is physically wrong with you. People sometimes seek medical attention in this case, undergoing several healthcare visits and medical investigations, which may not lead to any significant findings and may even put them at risk for adverse reactions. For instance, someone who suddenly cannot move and goes to the emergency room may be recommended to undergo a lumbar puncture procedure, which is invasive, painful, and unnecessary. One study found that there were an estimated 1,247,000 emergency department visits each year for anxiety-related symptoms.1 In addition to the physical feelings of anxiety, you may also feel emotionally paralyzed by anxiety. This can make it difficult to cope with what you are feeling and can interfere with relationships and other areas of life. When you are emotionally paralyzed by anxiety, you might avoid all anxiety-provoking situations and limit your life to a significant extent. An example is a person withagoraphobia, who due to anxiety becomes homebound and never leaves the house or needs a companion to do so. A more literal version of emotionally paralyzing anxiety is severe anxiety that takes over all your other emotions, making you unable to react to either good or bad events that may happen. Emotionally paralyzing anxiety can be more subtle, causing people around you to perceive you as aloof, inappropriately afraid, or preoccupied. It can affect other areas of your life such as social interactions,intimate relationships, or work performance, causing them to suffer. In some cases, people are so anxious that they avoid going for their healthcare appointments, and their health can suffer as well. When you are paralyzed with anxiety, you may also exhibit several other physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Some of these include: Zimbrean shares some treatment options and coping strategies that can help you deal feeling paralyzed by anxiety. CBTcan teach you to break the relationship between the emotion of the anxiety and the particular behavior that is getting in your way, such as the inability to move or do things that cause anxiety. CBT is considered a first-line treatment for anxiety. It is effective in treating different anxiety-related disorders, including panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder).3 Medications may sometimes be necessary to reduce the severity of your anxiety and prevent the recurrence of anxiety attacks.Benzodiazepineswork quickly, which is why they are typically used to relieve anxiety symptoms in the short term.Antidepressantscan help people who require long-term treatment but usually take a few weeks to begin working. Benzodiazepines are usually used only as a short-term treatment due to the increased risk for dependence and tolerance with long-term use.4 In addition to seeking professional treatment, Zimbrean also explains that there are a number of self-help techniques that can help ease feelings of paralyzing anxiety. Some of these tactics include the following: Identifying the factors thattriggeryour anxiety can be helpful. However, this is not always possible; sometimes, it is not always easily removed even if the element is identified. Meditationandmindfulnesstechniques can help you focus on the present and keep the anxiety at bay. Mindfulness is a practice that involves nonjudgmental awareness of a person's sensations, thoughts, and consciousness in the present moment. A 2018 study found that mindfulness-based interventions for anxiety were comparable to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in terms of efficacy.5 Maintaining your healthand undergoing regular health check-ups can help rule out physical health conditions. This makes it easier for healthcare providers to determine that the symptoms you are experiencing are due to anxiety. This is not always easy, as it is often counterintuitive that an emotional condition may cause a physical reaction. Other tactics that can be very helpful when you feel yourself becoming paralyzed with anxiety include deep breathing6and grounding techniques.7Regular exercise can also be a highly effective tool for managing anxiety.8 Anxiety can paralyze you physically or emotionally. Emotionally paralyzing anxiety can take a toll on your work and relationships, whereas physically paralyzing anxiety can affect your ability to perform daily tasks and in some cases, lead to lengthy medical investigations or risky procedures. You can seek treatment for your anxiety and more specifically for the paralysis you are experiencing. Treatment can take the form of therapy, medication, andmindfulness exercises. While it can seem daunting, it's important to take steps and seek professional help. Cleveland Clinic.Anxiety disorders: types, causes, symptoms, and treatments.

Follow Now:Apple Podcasts/Spotify/Google Podcasts/Amazon Music Sometimes, crippling anxiety is a sign of a diagnosable anxiety disorder. Here are some of the most common types of anxiety disorders and examples of how they might cause crippling anxiety. Crippling anxiety can be triggered by certain events and situations, regardless of whether you have an underlying anxiety disorder. Some examples of triggering events include: It is also possible to experience crippling anxiety without a trigger. People with an anxiety disorder, for example, may feel anxious all the time, not just after or during certain events. One of the most important things to know about crippling anxiety is that you're not alone. Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental illnesses in America, affecting approximately 40 million people.2You may feel that you're the only one, but there's no shame in asking for help. The most equipped person to treat your anxiety is a licensed mental health professional, like a therapist or psychiatrist. You can try out in-person therapy or an online therapist. Whichever type of treatment or therapy you choose, consider looking for someone specializing in anxiety disorders. Your treatment may include the following interventions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)is one of the most widely recognized therapeutic interventions for anxiety. As a problem-specific, goal-oriented approach, CBT focuses on the relationship between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. CBT involves various strategies that work together to shift your response to triggers or other underlying causes, including: Eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR)is a therapy that's frequently used alongside traditional treatment methods for anxiety. It's a short-term, 8-step method that uses repeated bilateral stimuli, as an object or finger moves back and forth while the person follows it with their eyes. Throughout these sessions, the individual addresses an anxiety-provoking situation, past trauma, or another issue, which ultimately helps reduce its impact throughout treatment. Exposure therapyis used to treat people who have extreme anxiety and phobias. It involves gradual exposure to the things you're afraid of through repeated contact over time until it becomes easier to face what triggers your fear. Anxiety can be treated with a variety ofmedicationsincluding benzodiazepines (which only need to be taken as needed), SSRI and SNRI antidepressants such as citalopram (Celexa) or duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbalta). You may also be able to deal with crippling anxiety as it arises with some of the following coping mechanisms: You don't need to live with crippling anxiety forever. It's manageable and responds well to treatment, but it can be tough when you're feeling lost in your thoughts of what the next day might bring. Remember that everyone is different and has their own needs. Working with a mental health professional can help determine which treatments work best for you.

https://www.verywellmind.com/does-magnesium-help-anxiety-5295894,dynamic,Mental Health,Magnesium for Anxiety,"Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the ""Everything Psychology Book."" Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. PixelsEffect / Getty Images Anxiety involves feelings of intense fear, unease, or nervousness. Such feelings can stem from particular events or situations, but they can also occur in a more generalized sense without a single identifiable source. No matter how it is experienced, anxiety is undoubtedly a common problem. According to the Anxiety and Depression Centers of America, 18.1% of adults in the United States experience anxiety each year.1 Since anxiety is so common, it’s not surprising that people often turn to a variety of methods to deal with it. One method that has recently gained traction is magnesium supplementation. Magnesium is an essential mineral that is required for a number of important body functions, including in the brain. However, research has found that dietary intake of this mineral is often insufficient.2But does this really mean magnesium can treat anxiety? Some evidence suggests it may help with anxiety, although more research is needed to better understand the connection. This article explores how anxiety is traditionally treated and whether or not magnesium might offer some benefits. It also explains how to take magnesium for anxiety, any side effects to watch for, and other benefits you might experience. The two primary treatments for anxiety arepsychotherapyandmedications. Some people may find that they get the greatest benefit from a combination of these two treatments,3although each person's experience and needs are different. Cognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT) is one evidence-based treatment often used to relieve symptoms of anxiety. It is a type of talk therapy that focuses on helping people recognize distorted thought patterns that contribute to anxiety. It also helps people develop more coping skills so they are better able to tolerate feelings of anxiety andreduce avoidance behaviors. A number of medications may also be prescribed to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Some types of antidepressants can be helpful, as can an anxiolytic medication calledbuspirone.Beta-blockers, which are often used to reduce blood pressure, and a type of sedative known asbenzodiazepinesare sometimes prescribed for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. Magnesium is one of the most common minerals found in the body, yet many adults get less than they need from diet alone. While a true deficiency tends to be rare, estimates suggest that as few as 48% of adults get less than the recommended amount each day.4 Given its role in functions ranging from energy levels to homeostasis to brain health, it is perhaps expected that deficiencies in the mineral have been implicated in mental health concerns. In a review of studies, researchers found that people withdepressionand other psychiatric conditions were more likely to have lower magnesium levels.5 One reason magnesium might be beneficial for anxiety is its ability to boost brain function and affect cortisol levels in the body.Cortisolis a hormone associated with stress, so lowering its levels in the body may have some impact on relieving anxiety.6 Some studies have suggested taking magnesium supplements may be helpful for relieving symptoms of differenttypes of anxiety. One 2017 review, for example, found magnesium supplementation appeared to reduce subjective symptoms of mild anxiety,generalized anxiety, and anxiety associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS).7However, this review noted that the quality of the current evidence was poor and randomized controlled trials were needed to further explore the effect. Such results are promising, but other studies have not found the same effect. A 2020 review found that, while magnesium supplementation appeared to have positive results on depressive symptoms, there was no significant connection between magnesium levels and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder orpanic disorder.5 While magnesium may have some benefits for anxiety, the evidence remains mixed. More studies are needed to determine if taking magnesium supplements might reduce anxiety and to compare its impact against other effective treatments including antidepressant medications and psychotherapy. Magnesium is available in a variety of types. It can be bound to different substances, which may impact the rate and degree to which the body is able to absorb it. Some of the main types of magnesium supplements available include: Which type of magnesium should you take for anxiety? In a 2019 study comparing the bioavailability and metabolism of different magnesium preparations, magnesium taurate was found to absorb the fastest, pass into the brain the quickest, and result in the highest brain tissue concentrations. It was also associated with decreased indicators of anxiety. The two least bioavailable types of those tested were magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate.11 Magnesium supplements are available in tablet, capsule, powder, and liquid forms. Tablet and capsule forms are taken orally with food. In most cases, tablets should be taken whole without breaking, crushing, or sucking on them. Some capsule tablets may be broken open and added to soft foods before eating. However, you should always check with your doctor first. Powder forms are mixed with liquid before they are consumed by mouth. Liquid doses are often taken as a laxative. The recommended dietary allowance for adults aged 18 to 30 is 400 mg for men and 310 mg for women. For adults over age 31, the recommended dietary allowance is 420 mg for men and 320 mg for women.12 Your magnesium needs can also often be met by consuming dietary sources of the mineral. Good sources of magnesium include:12 There is no standard recommended dose of magnesium for relieving anxiety, so you should always speak to your doctor before taking them for this purpose. Magnesium is generally well-tolerated and is unlikely to produce adverse effects even when taken at maximum daily limits. The National Institutes of Health suggests the body is able to naturally manage and excrete any excess magnesium consumed from dietary sources in healthy individuals.12 If you are taking magnesium via supplements, however, use caution to avoid exceeding the established upper limits. For adults, this means you should not consume more than 350 mg per day unless otherwise directed by a healthcare professional. Some forms of magnesium, such as magnesium citrate, may cause some symptoms of stomach upset or diarrhea. In addition to its potential benefits for anxiety, taking magnesium may have a number of other health benefits. Magnesium plays an important part in other bodily functions including regulating blood sugar levels, blood pressure, heart rhythm, immunity, and muscle function. Research suggests magnesium supplementation may be helpful for: Taking magnesium can also be helpful if you are deficient in this important mineral. Signs of magnesium deficiency can include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. As symptoms become more severe, people may experience muscle cramps, numbness, seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, and personality changes.12 If you suspect you have a magnesium deficiency, you should talk to your doctor immediately. Consuming very large doses of magnesium can lead to a rare side effect known as magnesium toxicity. This risk is higher for people who have kidney disease due to a reduced ability to remove excess magnesium from the body. Symptoms of a magnesium overdose can include: Such large doses are typically consumed via the excess use of laxatives and antacids, resulting in the consumption of more than 5,000 mg per day of magnesium. In very rare instances, this can be fatal.12 Magnesium may be helpful for anxiety, but research results remain mixed and there is simply not enough evidence to recommend taking this supplement to treat anxiety. Ensuring that you are getting adequate dietary levels of magnesium can be a great way to protect your health and reap the potential health benefits of this mineral. If you are concerned about your magnesium levels or want to try magnesium supplements for anxiety, talk to your primary care physician or another healthcare practitioner. They can offer more specific advice about dosages and which type of magnesium may be the most appropriate for your needs. ADAA.Facts and Statistics.

https://www.verywellmind.com/dissociation-anxiety-4692760,dynamic,Mental Health,Dissociation and Anxiety,"Arlin Cuncic, MA, is the author of The Anxiety Workbook and founder of the website About Social Anxiety. She has a Master's degree in clinical psychology. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Verywell / JR Bee If you've ever felt disconnected from the world when you're anxious, you've probably wondered how to stop dissociating because of anxiety. Dissociation anxiety is not a specific diagnosis or set of symptoms. Rather, dissociation is a symptom, and it may be related to anxiety.1 When a person experiences dissociation, they become disconnected from their surroundings or from themselves. This reaction works to temporarily alleviate potentially overwhelming emotional experiences such as traumatic memories and may temporarily reduce feelings of shame, anxiety, or fear—but it doesn't function as a healthy long-term fix. Dissociation related to anxiety may occur during a stressful, anxiety-inducing event or during or after a period of intense worry. Because dissociation is based onavoidance coping, it ""works"" in the short term but has long-term negative consequences. Dissociation refers to being disconnected from the present moment. It is a subconscious way of coping with and avoiding a traumatic situation or negative thoughts. While about half of people may have experienced an event of dissociation in their lifetime, only about 2% are actually diagnosed with what is known as a dissociative disorder.2 Dissociation usually happens in response to a traumatic life event such as that which is faced while being in the military or experiencing abuse. In this way, dissociation is usually associated with trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, dissociation can also happen in the context of anxiety symptoms andanxiety disorders. Often, dissociation that happens due to extreme stress or panic is recognized but attributed to other causes such as health issues. A person with panic disorder may seek medical attention for these symptoms and feel powerless to stop them. Overall, dissociation interferes with the treatment of all types of disorders and makes it hard to pay attention to the present moment. It can also slow or prevent healthytrauma processing and coping. Because of this, it's important to address dissociation through treatment and learn ways to cope. The process of dissociation usually occurs outside your own awareness, though you may also realize it is happening, particularly if it is in the context of anxiety. The experience involves a disconnection between your memory, consciousness, identity, and thoughts. In other words, while normally your brain processes events (such as your memories, identity, perceptions, motor function, etc.) together, during dissociation, these parts splinter, leaving you with a feeling of disconnection. Dissociation is a general term that refers to a detachment from many things. With depersonalization, your mind feels disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, actions, or body. Examples of this include feeling like you are watching a movie about yourself or that you don't have an identity. Some of the symptoms experienced as a result of depersonalization include:2 Derealization causes a sensation where the world does not feel real. Examples of this include seeing the world all in shades of grey or having tunnel vision when looking at the world. The symptoms involved with derealization include:3﻿ There are three types of dissociative disorders in theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5). However, these are separate from dissociation related to anxiety: Again, there is no diagnosis of ""dissociation anxiety,"" although dissociation can be a symptom associated with anxiety disorders. The major anxiety disorders that may be related to dissociation as a symptom include:2 While the exact cause of dissociation is unclear, experts note that dissociation correlates with mood and anxiety disorders and is also a way of dealing with trauma. As a result, dissociation often affects people who have experienced the following types of trauma:4 When dissociation is related to anxiety or panic, it tends to occur for a shorter period of time than when it is due to trauma or abuse or as a symptom of a diagnosable dissociative disorder. In the case of anxiety, it is constant, low-level stress that puts a strain on your nervous system and eventually may cause you to dissociate to protect yourself; but remember, this all happens mostly at a level that you are likely not aware of. Anxiety is a treatable condition. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that all adults below the age of 65 get screened for symptoms of an anxiety disorder during their regular doctor's visits.5 Although there is no specific treatment for dissociation, medications, and psychotherapy have been shown to help. While there are no medications to specifically treat dissociation, your doctor may prescribe antipsychotics, antidepressants, or anti-anxiety medications to alleviate some of the symptoms of a dissociative condition.6 Treatment for dissociation related to anxiety usually will involve psychotherapy (such ascognitive behavioral therapyordialectical behavior therapy).3Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is another therapy that is sometimes used. Since dissociation can interfere with the effectiveness of treatment, your therapist may ask you to do the following things to snap out of a period of dissociation: The key to managing dissociation related to anxiety is to practice grounding techniques to bring yourself back into the present moment. You can do this by always having a ""grounding plan"" that you put in place when you find yourself spacing out or otherwise feeling as though you are dissociating. While you may not be able to control dissociation, you can reduce the likelihood of it happening and also try to learn to ignore it when it does happen rather than letting your anxiety make it spiral out of control. In other words, the dissociation will stop when your brain no longer feels the need to protect you. Some preventative steps that you can take to manage dissociation related to anxiety include the following: Are you concerned about dissociation anxiety? It could be that you actually have anxiety about your dissociation, rather than dissociation that is simply caused by anxiety. If you are finding yourself very worried about dissociation symptoms, such as feeling detached from the world or things not feeling real, it's important to speak to your doctor or a mental health professional about how you are feeling and what can be done to help you feel better. Only a professional can determine whether your symptoms are related to trauma or anxiety, or some combination of the two, which will influence your treatment plan. Finally, if you don't notice dissociation yourself, but others seem concerned about your behavior, it may still be worth seeking help. Dissociation is not always consciously recognized, so you may still be experiencing it. If you or a loved one are struggling with dissociation anxiety or another mental health issue, contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat1-800-662-4357for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see ourNational Helpline Database. Dissociation can be a symptom of anxiety, particularly when a person is experiencing a great deal of stress or when the situation is inescapable. Dissociation can also be a symptom of other mental health conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. When you experience dissociation caused by anxiety, you may feel detached and disconnected from yourself. Your perceptions may change and time may seem to go faster or slower. You may feel emotionally numb, and the experience may seem unreal, flat, or dull. Signs that you might be dissociating include: If you are experiencing dissociation, it is important to talk to a mental health professional. They can recommend treatments, including medications and therapy, that can help. In terms of managing dissociation on your own, finding ways to groud yourself in reality is important. When you start to dissociate, work on grounding and centering yourself in the moment. Making eye contact with another person, naming things you can detect with your senses, focusing on aspects of your environment, or consciously forcing yourself to avoid zoning out are a few strategies you can try.

https://www.verywellmind.com/adhd-medication-and-anxiety-6455495,dynamic,Mental Health,ADHD Medications and Anxiety,"Zuva Seven is a freelance writer and editor focused on the nuanced exploration of mental health, health, and wellness. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. It is not uncommon for people with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to also have aco-occurring anxiety disorder. Because the two conditions share some similar symptoms, such as restlessness, it is important to rule out anxiety or other conditions when making an ADHD diagnosis. Additionally,stimulant-based medicationcan sometimes cause anxiety symptoms to worsen. Learn which medications can cause anxiety symptoms, as well as alternative treatment methods that can be utilized. We also share general coping mechanisms to further support and help with your mental health journey. If you're taking medication for ADHD and feel your anxiety is worsening, contact your healthcare provider. The medication may need to be adjusted, changed, or discontinued to reduce this effect. ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorderthat affects an estimated 4% of the world’s population.1A neurodevelopmental disorder is a group of conditions that have their onset in the developmental period and generally present early in life in ways that affect the brain’s development and produce impairments in functioning. Other neurodevelopmental disorders includespecific learning disorders, which can sometimes be mistaken for ADHD.2 While it is usually identified in childhood, ADHD is lifelong. Traits can vary from person to person, withthree major subtypesthat each have their own unique characteristics:3 Various methods can be implemented to help people with ADHD manage day-to-day tasks and tendencies. This includes psychotherapy,social skills training, lifestyle changes, andspecial accommodations, but also certain medications. ADHD medicationsfall into two groups, stimulants and non-stimulants. The type of medication most suitable for a person will depend on their specific symptoms and circumstances. Stimulants are considered the first-line treatment for ADHD and often the most effective; thus, they are the most common type of medication to help with ADHD symptoms while they are active in the body.4But how do they work? The chemicals norepinephrine and dopamine play a key role in regulating attention andexecutive function. These chemicals tend to be lower in those with ADHD, so stimulants work by increasing their availability in the brain. When the activity and communication of the parts of the brain that rely on these chemicals increase, ADHD symptoms decrease. The most common stimulant-based medications include the following: Non-stimulant medicationsare another treatment option for ADHD. This option may be recommended for those who don’t experience adequate improvement on stimulants, experience severe adverse side effects from stimulants, and/or if the healthcare provider wants to pair a non-stimulant with a stimulant to increase medication effectiveness.4 The most common non-stimulant-based medications include:5 ADHD and anxiety often co-exist, and they can also exacerbate the effects of each other. For instance, around 25% of adults withgeneralized anxiety disorder(GAD) also have a comorbid ADHD diagnosis.6 Additionally, some stimulant-based ADHD medications can make anxiety symptoms worse, such as Adderall or Ritalin.7However, these anxiety symptoms may subside after some time.8 “Some symptoms — like fidgeting andtrouble concentrating— are hallmarks of both ADHD and anxiety,"" says Damaris Chukwura, Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner at Heading Health. ""As a result, clinicians must rule out anxiety and other mental disorders when diagnosing ADHD, and vice versa."" Should your anxiety symptoms worsen due to your stimulant medications, non-stimulant-based medication may be an alternative mode of treatment. While ADHD medication is effective at helping people function in everyday life,9as with all medication, there is the potential for side effects. It is important to note that not everyone who takes the medication will experience the same side effects to the same severity. Additionally, many of these adverse effects can subside with time. If you experience any side effects that cause significant distress or impact your daily functioning, it is essential to have a discussion with your primary care provider. Stimulant-based medication to treat ADHD can cause:4 To minimize the side effects of ADHD medication, medical practitioners can implement a range of techniques. This includes starting with a low dose and titrating the medication to find your body’s optimal dose. In some instances, switching to a different medication may be recommended. This can happen in two ways : switching from an amphetamine-based ADHD medication to a methylphenidate-based one, or switching from a long-acting agent to a short-acting agent (and visa-versa). There is also the option of taking “medication holidays.” Additionally, it is common for physicians to recommend regular meetings, particularly initially. This is so they can monitor your symptoms, side effects, and the medication's impact on your weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and general health and well-being. As mentioned, individuals with ADHD are more likely to have an anxiety disorder than individuals without the condition. In cases such as this, it is important to treat both conditions. Psychotherapy and several types of medications are used in the management of anxiety disorders. It is often possible to take medications prescribed for anxiety disorders along with those for ADHD. However, this needs to be done under a medical professional’s close supervision. That said, it is crucial to keep in mind that a combination of medicine and therapy has been found to be most beneficial for individuals with ADHD and anxiety disorder.11 Additionally, for some individuals, stimulant medication can reduce the impact of anxiety. For example, a 2016 study on children with ADHD found that both atomoxetine and methylphenidate-based medication reduced the symptoms of ADHD and anxiety.12 While there are many techniques your medical practitioner can implement to help with your ADHD, there is a range of other methods you can carry out yourself. Here are some tips you can try: It is also important not to put unhelpful pressure on yourself to always excel at these things. No one can perform at the same caliber every day, so it’s also vital to give yourself grace. Consistency doesn’t require perfection.

She has a Master's degree in clinical psychology. Dr. Sabrina Romanoff, PsyD, is a licensed clinical psychologist and a professor at Yeshiva University’s clinical psychology doctoral program. Rebecca Smith / Getty Images Destination anxiety refers to the belief thathappinessis waiting for you at some point in the future when you attain something. This can be a new job, relationship, material possession, or anything else that you believe will make you happy. The problem with this way of thinking is that it leads to a feeling of dissatisfaction with your current life and a constant yearning for something more. This can cause immense amounts ofstress and anxiety, as well as prevent you from enjoying the present moment. If you live with destination anxiety, it is essential to realize that happiness is not something that you need to wait for. It is something that you can find right now, in the present moment. By learning toappreciate what you haveand finding contentment in the here and now, you can start to reduce your anxiety and stress levels. Additionally, it is important to remember that nothing in life is guaranteed. Even if you do achieve your goals, there is no guarantee that you will be happy. So, instead of chasing after happiness, focus on enjoying the journey and living your life to the fullest. The concept of destination anxiety is not new. It has been around for centuries and has been spoken about by many different philosophers and thinkers.1 The concept was discussed by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book ""Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.""2In this book, Csikszentmihalyi discusses the idea that humans are often unhappy because they are not living in the present moment. Instead, their minds are constantly focused on the past or the future. This can lead to a feeling of anxiety and stress, as well as prevent people from enjoying their lives. The idea of destination anxiety has also been discussed by other thinkers such asphilosopher Alan Wattsand self-help authorEckhart Tolle. Both of these individuals have spoken about the importance of living in the present moment and finding happiness within yourself. There are several signs that you may be living with destination anxiety. Need a breather?

However, it's also important to know what isn't helpful, such as telling them to just snap out of it or trying to force them to get help. Don't try to be their therapist—your goal is to offer support, kindness, and empathy. One of the most important things you can do to help someone with anxiety is to learn more about the condition. Knowing more about anxiety can help you empathize and understand more about the ways you can help. Anxiety disordersaffect 40 million American adults age 18 or older, or 19.1% of the population each year, making it the most common mental illness in the United States.1 While anxiety is a treatable disease, many people are never treated for it. Globally, only around 27.6% of people with an anxiety disorder receive treatment.2 Since anxiety is such a complex disorder, it can be difficult to define and diagnose with a single set of general criteria. Because of this, mental health professionals have broken down the disorder into several categories, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, andsocial anxiety disorder. Generalized anxiety disorderor GAD is characterized by excessive worry, thoughts, emotions, and actions that occur most of the time for at least six months. People with GAD typically worry about everyday activities such as work, money, family, and health. According to the National Institutes of Mental Health,panic disorderoccurs in people who have recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are sudden periods of intense fear, anxiety, or discomfort.3﻿ Some people experience a need to flee until the episode is over, which usually peaks in a matter of minutes. Also called social phobia, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) says this type of anxiety is characterized by an intense fear of being judged, negatively evaluated, or rejected in a social or performance situation.4Because of this, they often avoid these types of situations, and if they can’t, they experience significant anxiety and stress. Anxiety can manifest in many different ways and levels of severity. However, the symptoms or signs are often the same. While not an exhaustive list, the following are some of the most common physical, mental, and behavioral:5 Helping someone with anxietystarts with understanding and recognizing the signs of excessive worry and learning how to best support them. Many people with an anxiety disorder don’t recognize what is going on, says psychiatristGail Saltz, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of medicine. Friends and family often observe that their loved one needs help with anxiety, sometimes better than the loved one themselves. If your friend or loved one is frequently asking some form of ""what if something terrible happens"" and then looking to you for reassurance, Saltz says by reassuring them, you are actually perpetuating their anxiety. Instead, she recommends pointing out that because you care about them, you notice they are reassurance-seeking, and it's actually making them more anxious in the long run. Then, Saltz says you can suggest methods of decreasing their anxiety such as meditation practice, exercise, deep breathing, or talking to a therapist. “If you know someone who is struggling with anxiety, reach out to them and provide support by just listening to what they have to say,” says Catherine Richardson, LPC, aTalkspacetherapist. If you’re not sure how to start the conversation, Richardson says to ask them how you can help. Let them know they can come to you when they feel anxious and that you would like to be there for them. Together, you can come up with a plan to facilitate this process, such as meeting in person, talking on the phone, or connecting online. Richardson also recommends asking them if there is something they enjoy doing like going to the park, going to a particular restaurant, or watching a favorite movie, that you could do together. But most importantly, she says, encourage them to seek help if you feel like they are really struggling and could benefit from therapy. In addition to receiving professional medical help, individuals struggling with anxiety are encouraged to seek out ways to help manage their symptoms at home. There are a variety of approaches and activities people can try as part of an overall treatment plan, including: According to Saltz, it’s important to understand that continuing to be the one to say ""don’t worry about that because…"" is not actually helping, even if your friend or loved one thinks it is. “You can't make someone stop seeking reassurance, but you can tell them it's actually making the situation worse,” she says. Another mistake to avoid, Richardson says, is taking on the role of a clinical professional. Even if you have experience with anxiety, you don't always know what's best for someone else. Instead, Richardson recommends being supportive and transparent and let your friend or loved one know you're there for them. ""You can also share what might have worked for you, but then give them space andunconditional positive regardas they navigate their own journey,"" she says. It’s also important to avoid judging and blaming a loved one when they are feeling anxious. Even when you’re the most frustrated, stop, take a breath, and step back. They need to see that you love them unconditionally, even when anxiety is high. ""You may suggest help, but at the end of the day, you cannot force help,"" Saltz says. When this happens, Saltz says you can help themfind a therapistor offer to accompany them to the session, but you can't actually force them to go or force them to participate in a meaningful way. Knowing your limitations also includes taking care of yourself. This is especially true if you are in a relationship with someone who is dealing with anxiety. By talking to a mental health expert, you can better understand your role and how to best manage emotions while supporting a loved one. Even if your friend or loved one has a list of resources or websites dedicated to anxiety, you can still research helpful sites, books, articles, and apps to share with them. If you have access to a doctor or mental health expert familiar with treating anxiety, you can also ask them for resources. Here are some to start: Even though the symptoms of anxiety can feel overwhelming and permanent, anxiety is highly treatable. If someone you love is experiencing pervasive anxiety, or you have concerns that anxiety is interfering with daily life, encourage them to seek help from their primary care physician or mental health professional. Of all the ways to help someone with anxiety, this may be the most important one. As a friend or loved one, your role is to offer support, not treatment. Offer to assist with locating a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist that treats anxiety. Talk to them aboutonlineand in-person therapy options. Individuals living with anxiety can often feel better by undergoing a combination oftherapies,including psychotherapy, medication, and self-management.

Verywell / Laura Porter How do you distinguish between anxiety vs. being nervous? After all, it's common to hear someone say, ""This is giving me anxiety!"" when faced with a situation that makes them uncomfortable or nervous. But although the terms ""anxiety"" and ""nervous"" are often used interchangeably, feeling nervous and having an anxiety disorder are two very different things. So how do you know if the nervousness you're feeling is normal or actually an anxiety disorder? This article explores the differences between being nervous vs. anxious and offers tips for how to manage both. Nervousness is a natural reaction to a stressful situation. It usually hits when you face a new or important challenge, such as taking an exam or giving a presentation to a room full of people. You might be nervous when waiting for medical test results lab results or before walking into a job interview. Many physical sensations can accompany nervousness, including a dry mouth, sweaty palms, and dizziness. You may also experience feelings of self-doubt. These feelings and sensations are both uncomfortable and uncontrollable. Nervousness tends to go away once you've gotten through the situation. And it rarely leads to you avoid nerve-wracking situations in the future. Feelings of nervousness that don't disrupt your everyday life are normal. Anxiety, on the other hand, is something you deal with on an ongoing basis. You live your life in a constant state of dread, and you struggle to calm yourself. In addition to the physical symptoms, the suffocating feeling of dread accompanying anxiety disorders can even compel you toavoid places or situationsthat incite these uncomfortable symptoms. These feelings and negative coping behaviors eventually begin to interfere with your day-to-day life.1 For instance, it's normal to feel nervous about going to the doctor because of what you could learn. But if your fear becomes so overwhelming that you avoid going to the doctor altogether, you may have adiagnosable anxiety disorder. Nervousness and anxiety are similar in that both cause a variety of physical and cognitive symptoms. But that's where the similarities end. Remember that while nervousness can be a sign of an anxiety disorder, it's very common to experience it from time to time without actually having an anxiety disorder. Temporary Less intense Response to something specific Rarely leads to negative coping behaviors Manageable with self-care Persistent and ongoing More intense Often more generalized Interferes with daily life May require therapy or medication If you are prone to nervousness, there are several ways to ease your symptoms. The following are some easy tips to can help get your nerves under control: There are different ways that you may be able to overcome mild anxiety on your own to enjoy better emotional wellness. Below are three strategies you might try to cope with your anxious feelings: Whatever you do, try not to avoid anxiety-provoking situations. Although avoidance may give you some short-term relief, it onlyhurts you in the long run. If your anxiety is so intense that you're unable to cope with it, you may have an anxiety disorder. This anxiety can be a symptom of many conditions, including: Each condition presents its unique symptoms. However, all anxiety disorders involve excessive fear, worry, or dread that interfere with your daily activities.

If you think you're experiencing symptoms in your daily life to an intense degree, you may have an anxiety disorder. It's essential to reach out to a mental health provider to help confirm a diagnosis. Then, they can work with you to determine the best treatment plan to address and manage your anxiety. Feelings of nervousness can be a sign of anxiety, but nervousness tends to be mild and emerge due to specific situations. Anxiety, on the other hand, is usually more serious and pervasive. It is possible to experience physical feelings of anxiety without necessarily feeling nervous about a specific situation. Instead, you might have generalized feelings of anxiety that don't seem to stem from any particular source.
